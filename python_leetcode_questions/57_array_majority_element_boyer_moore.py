""" 
Given an array  of size n, find the majority element.
The majority element is the element that appears more than : n/2 : times.

Hints: The must be only 1 element because only 1 elemment can appear n/2.

Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm:  
The Boyer-Moore voting method is one of the most often used optimum algorithms 
for determining the majority element among elements with more than N/2 occurrences. 
This works wonderfully for finding the majority element, which requires 
two traversals over the provided items and is O(N) time and O(1) space complexity.
