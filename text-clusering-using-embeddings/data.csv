"Live updates: Israel-Hamas war rages, hostages talks, Gaza crisis","Bill Burns, director of the CIA, is expected to meet with officials from Israel, Egypt and Qatar to discuss a deal to secure the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas, according to a US official familiar with the plans.

The meetings come amid intensive discussions on the parameters of a new deal that would pair hostages’ release with a cessation in the fighting in Gaza. The meetings are expected to be held in Europe, the official said.

US officials said they remain focused on securing a release of hostages after a leaked recording said to be of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticizing Qatar drew anger from the Gulf state.

"January 25, 2024 Israel-Hamas war","Palestinians flee Khan Younis, moving toward Rafah, in the wake of the Israeli ground operation, in the southern Gaza , on Thursday, January 25. Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters

As the Gaza war nears its fifth month, with more than 25,000 Palestinians – civilians and combatants – dead and Israel nowhere close to achieving its objective of destroying Hamas, no one seems to have come up with a concrete proposal that’s palatable to both parties to pause the conflict, let alone end it. But there are suggestions, however half-baked, from both sides, that show a willingness to talk.

Indeed, Qatar — the main go-between — says there are “serious discussions” with Israel and Hamas, and is receiving “constant replies” from both sides. They’re not “negotiations” yet, says the White House. But with indirect talks ongoing, we seem to be inching toward what Ofer Shelah, Senior Researcher with Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), describes as a “Zopa” — a zone of possible agreement.

On Monday Axios reported Israel had proposed a two-month truce in exchange for the release of all the 100-plus hostages still held in Gaza. Later that day CNN learned that Mossad chief David Barnea had suggested allowing Hamas leaders to go into exile as part of a broader ceasefire.

On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal said Hamas was now open to releasing some of the hostages in exchange for a pause in the fighting. And Reuters reported that Israel and Hamas had agreed in principle to a one-month truce, during which abductees would be freed and Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails released.

January 25 - 2024 campaign updates,"Former President Donald Trump arrives for a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Saturday, January 20. Matt Rourke/AP

Donald Trump’s New Hampshire triumph puts him on a GOP primary tier few, if any, Republicans have reached. Unofficial returns at time of publication have the former president at about 55% of the vote.

He’s only the second nonincumbent Republican to win a majority of the GOP primary vote in New Hampshire in the modern era. The only other was Ronald Reagan in 1980, and Trump’s 55% surpasses Reagan’s 50.2%. He is also just the second nonincumbent Republican to win the New Hampshire primary twice in the modern era. The other Republican was John McCain.

The fact that Trump was able to win both Iowa and New Hampshire is quite unusual. No other nonincumbent Republican has ever done it. Mitt Romney in 2012 came the closest (winning New Hampshire but losing Iowa by 24 votes) – and he took less than 40% in New Hampshire and under 25% of the vote in Iowa.

Trump’s ability to win Iowa and New Hampshire with such ease tells you how strong his candidacy is among Republicans. He appeals to different parts of the party, as evidenced by the fact that he succeeded in two very different contests in two fairly different states:

Iowa is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate.

is a low turnout caucus that engages most with core party activists, dominated by conservatives and evangelical Christians. Few non-Republicans participate. New Hampshire sees a relatively high turnout primary that openly invites registered independents (or undeclared voters). The Granite State voters are more moderate, far less religious and wealthier than Iowa's.

Put another way, New Hampshire should have been a far worse state for Trump. His biggest backers look a lot more like the Iowa electorate than New Hampshire voters: conservatives, religious Republicans and Republicans of more modest financial means.

But none of that stopped Trump from pulling in the largest share of the vote for an non-incumbent in New Hampshire GOP primary history. It seems quite plausible at this point that Trump may pull off the ultimate historic GOP primary win: becoming the first non-incumbent Republican to go undefeated in all 50 states during the primary season.","['campaign', '25', 'primary', 'republican', 'nonincumbent', 'updates', 'iowa', 'trump', '2024', 'voters', 'republicans', 'hampshire', 'gop', 'win']",CNN

"U.S. and China are working to make the business environment less volatile, Beijing says","The flags of China, U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party are displayed in a flag stall at the Yiwu Wholesale Market in Yiwu, Zhejiang province, China, May 10, 2019. Aly Song | Reuters

BEIJING — China and the U.S. are working toward creating a more stable and predictable environment for businesses, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said Friday. Since U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's visit to China last summer, the two countries have agreed to hold regular meetings at the ministerial level and below. Wang and Raimondo had a call earlier this month. That communication ""strives to create a good environment for the two countries' economic and trade cooperation, especially in stabilizing business expectations,"" Wang said in Mandarin at a press conference, translated by CNBC. He did not mention U.S. tech restrictions, but said sanctions bring business uncertainty and ""greatly increase"" compliance costs. In the last two years, the Biden administration has issued export controls that limit the ability of Chinese companies to buy advanced tech such as high-end semiconductors from U.S. businesses. Washington has said it's a way to keep China's military from accessing cutting-edge tech, while maintaining areas of cooperation.

""We always believe that the common interests of China and the U.S. in economy and trade are far greater than their differences,"" Wang said. U.S. and other foreign businesses in China have long complained of challenges to doing business in the Asian country, such as unequal treatment of foreign companies compared to local players. More recently, international businesses have said Beijing's vague rules around data transfer out of the country make operations difficult. In the fall, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued new draft rules that said no government oversight is needed for data exports if regulators haven't stipulated that it qualifies as ""important."" The move was widely seen as an improvement for foreign businesses, but no official policy has yet followed. When asked Friday for an update on data rules, Wang only said the ""primary ministry is stepping up efforts to release them."" He said China has acted on a 24-point plan released last summer for supporting foreign businesses in the country — with implementation or progress on ""more than 60%"" of the measures. Wang also said the ministry has set up regular channels for foreign businesses to share feedback. When Raimondo visited China last year, she called for more action to improve predictability for U.S. businesses in China. Referring to the 24-point plan, she had said: ""Any one of those could be addressed as a way to show action.""

Growing international challenges

China's economic growth has slowed from the double-digit pace of prior decades to a 5.2% increase in 2023. Growth is expected to slow further this year. Wang told reporters Friday that this year, the international trade situation would be ""even more complex and severe,"" pointing to factors such as increased geopolitical tensions. Foreign direct investment fell by 8% to 1.13 trillion yuan ($160 billion) in 2023, the lowest level in three years, according to Ministry of Commerce data. It did not specify how much the U.S. invested in China, while noting France and the U.K. saw the largest increases in such investment last year.","['trade', 'foreign', 'rules', 'beijing', 'business', 'ministry', 'working', 'international', 'volatile', 'businesses', 'data', 'wang', 'environment', 'china', 'tech']",CNBC
LVMH shares jump 8% as earnings point to luxury sector resilience,"Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, speaks during a press conference to present the 2023 annual results of LVMH in Paris, France, January 25, 2024.

LVMH shares jumped more than 8% on Friday morning, after the world's largest luxury group posted higher-than-expected sales for 2023 and raised its annual dividend.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, as well as brands including Givenchy, Bulgari and Sephora, on Thursday night reported sales amounting to 86.15 billion euros ($93.34 billion) for 2023, exceeding consensus forecasts and equating to 13% organic growth from the previous year.

Organic revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter.

The result was boosted in particular by 14% annual growth in the critical fashion and leather goods sector, along with 11% growth in perfumes and cosmetics. Wines and spirits meanwhile posted a 4% decline.

""Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to spark desire, despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges,"" Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement.

""While remaining vigilant in the current context, we enter 2024 with confidence, backed by our highly desirable brands and our agile teams.""

After a boom during the pandemic, the luxury sector endured a rough end to 2023 as challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions weighed on consumer spending, particularly in the U.S. and China.

LVMH in April 2023 became the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value, but a share price decline over the last six months allowed it to be eclipsed as Europe's largest company by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk.

British luxury brand Burberry earlier this month issued a profit warning in response to slowing demand, as the balloon in high-end spending that peaked during the pandemic loses air. At the time, the news sent Burberry shares plunging and dragged down the wider sector.

Yet luxury stocks broadly advanced on Thursday as investors took heart from LVMH's reassuring results. Burberry's own shares were up 1.7% Friday morning.

Javier Gonzalez Lastra, portfolio manager of the Tema Luxury ETF, told CNBC on Thursday that investors are trying to gauge where the bottom of the earnings cycle revision is for the luxury sector. He predicted that earnings are ""likely to get tougher"" through the first half of 2024 because of last year's unusually high annual comparisons.

Arnault, however, is pinning some hope on LVMH's partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympics, which he said ""provides a new opportunity to reinforce our global leadership position in luxury goods and promote France's reputation for excellence around the world.","['sector', 'annual', 'luxury', 'lvmh', 'earnings', 'growth', 'billion', 'shares', 'resilience', '2024', 'point', '2023', 'vuitton', 'jump']",CNBC
Shein rejects Amazon 'clone' talk as it prepares for U.S. listing,"Chinese-founded online retail giant Shein is not positioning itself as an Amazon ""clone,"" the company told CNBC, ahead of its hotly anticipated U.S. public listing later this year.

The e-commerce company's product categories are likely to ""grow over time,"" as the business entrenches itself deeper into the U.S., Peter Pernot-Day, head of strategic communications, U.K. and U.S., said. But that expansion will vary from market to market, and skew heavily toward Generation Z — born between the late 1990s and early 2000s — and younger Millennial consumers, who were born between the early 1980s and late 1990s.

""I don't see us an an Amazon clone per se,"" Pernot-Day said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

The Singapore-headquartered fashion brand has already ventured into product lines as diverse as electronics, sports and home appliances, after winning over millions of U.S. shoppers during the pandemic with its low-cost and seemingly limitless clothing lines.

It is now forecast to supersede high street rivals H&M and Zara owner Inditex, with estimated revenues of $24 billion in the first nine months of 2023, according to tech publication The Information.

""One of the things we are very good at is measuring and responding to customer demand and that flexibility allows us to tailor our offering to different geographies,"" Pernot-Day said.

""So, product categories vary across these markets. But the core point is that being receptive and responsive to Generation Z, younger Millennial shoppers, is something that leads to growth,"" he added.","['late', 'shein', 'amazon', 'clone', 'product', 'vary', 'listing', 'talk', 'millennial', 'pernotday', 'z', 'market', 'generation', 'prepares', 'younger', 'rejects', 'shoppers']",CNBC
AI hiring frenzy to fuel layoffs in other tech segments as firms strive to balance costs,"Stick figures image displayed on a laptop screen and a binary code displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on January 24, 2023. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)

As tech firms prioritize investments into artificial intelligence and go on a hiring spree, other segments are likely to see layoffs continue into 2024, according to industry experts.

More than 20,000 tech employees have already lost jobs so far in 2024, according to tracker layoffs.fyi.

""Google and the rest of Big Tech are betting big on AI while cutting back on non-strategic areas. Layoffs will continue to happen for Big Tech in some areas while the hiring frenzy in AI will be unprecedented as this arms race continues across the tech world,"" Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai last week warned employees there would be more job cuts this year as the company continues to shift investments toward AI.

""We have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,"" Pichai wrote in a Jan. 17 memo to employees, adding that the management was gearing up to share its AI goals and objectives for 2024. ""The reality is that to create the capacity for this investment, we have to make tough choices,"" Pichai said.

'Unshirkable responsibility': China's financial institutions urged to support property developers,"China's financial institutions should provide strong support to the country's beleaguered real estate sector and not ""blindly withdraw"" financing for projects facing difficulties, according to a senior Chinese financial regulatory official.

His strongly worded comments follow the Chinese central bank's largest cut in mandatory cash reserves for banks since 2021. Beijing also recently released a fresh policy mandate aimed at easing the cash crunch for Chinese developers, which have struggled under the crackdown on the sector's bloated debt.

""The financial industry has an unshirkable responsibility and must provide strong support,"" said Xiao Yuanqi, deputy director of China's National Financial Regulatory Administration, at a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, according to a CNBC translation.

""We all know the real estate industry chain is long and involves a wide range of areas. It has an important impact on the national economy and is closely related to people's lives,"" he added.

China's real estate troubles are closely intertwined with local government finances since they typically relied on land sales to developers for a significant portion of revenue.","['provide', 'estate', 'support', 'unshirkable', 'property', 'institutions', 'chinas', 'financial', 'developers', 'urged', 'real', 'national', 'chinese', 'responsibility', 'strong', 'industry', 'regulatory']",CNBC
Commodity markets are in a 'super squeeze' — and higher prices could be here to stay,"SUIXI, CHINA - DECEMBER 30: An employee works on the production line of aluminum foil at a workshop of Anhui Limu New Material Technology Co., Ltd on December 30, 2023 in Suixi County, Huaibei City, Anhui Province of China.

Global commodity markets are in a ""super squeeze"" amid supply disruptions and lack of investment — and it's only going to get worse as geopolitical and climate risks exacerbate the situation, HSBC said. ""For some time now we have described global commodity markets as being in a 'super-squeeze,'"" its chief economist Paul Bloxham told CNBC. A commodity ""super squeeze"" is denoted by higher prices driven by supply constraints more than a robust growth in demand, he explained. ""If it's a supply constraint that's driving high commodity prices, it's a very different story for global growth,"" said via Zoom. Higher prices as a result of a super squeeze are ""not as positive."" ""We see the deeper 'super-squeeze' factors on the supply-side as still set to play a key role in keeping commodity prices elevated,"" he said, outlining factors like political uncertainties, climate change and the lack of investments into the green energy transition.

The super squeeze could be deeper, or more prolonged if geopolitical, climate change or energy transition related supply disruptions are larger than expected. Paul Bloxham HSBC chief economist

Geopolitical risks include the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza and the Ukraine war, which have hampered global trade, as seen in shipping disruptions from the recent Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. Another reason is climate change, which disrupts supply chains as well as commodities supply, especially in the agricultural space. ""The super squeeze could be deeper, or more prolonged if geopolitical, climate change or energy transition related supply disruptions are larger than expected,"" he added.

Lack of investments

The world's pursuit of a net-zero carbon future is fueling demand for energy transition metals such as copper and nickel, Bloxham pointed out. However, there are insufficient investments allocated to procuring these critical minerals, leading to a sharper supply squeeze on energy transition metals — in particular copper, aluminum and nickel, he said. As energy transition ramps up, markets could be looking at a shortage of a slew of metals like graphite, cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium in the next decade, the Energy Transitions Commission said in a report in July.

watch now

At the recent COP28 climate change conference, more than 60 countries backed a plan to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030, in what is largely deemed as a step forward for energy transition and a further boost in demand for metals required for that transition. ""Large-scale mining projects can take 15-20 years, and the last decade has seen a lack of investment in exploration and production for key energy transition materials,"" the report said. Annual capital investments in these metals averaged $45 billion in the last two decades, and must rise to around $70 billion each year through to 2030 to ensure an ample stream of supply, according to the ETC report.

Commodities are notoriously volatile asset classes, with a long history that is prone to a short squeeze and the current landscape points to more of the same. Brian Luke S&P Dow Jones Indices

Without more investment in new capacities, supply will be constrained, HSBC's Bloxham said, adding that ""for any given amount of demand,"" it should be expected that commodity prices will stay more elevated than in the past. ""That seems to be playing out across many of the commodities at the moment."" Technology could also be a gamechanger if a development came along and made it much easier to extract the metals used in the battery space, Bloxham added.

He did not say how long it will take global commodity markets to move out of the squeeze, but one way out of it — which would also push commodity prices lower — is a ""bigger and deeper [economic] downturn globally,"" he said. ""Commodities are notoriously volatile asset classes, with a long history that is prone to a short squeeze and the current landscape points to more of the same,"" said Brian Luke, senior director and head of commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices. He highlighted that extreme weather events and geopolitics have also impacted the agricultural and energy commodity baskets.

Metals most impacted

Analysts say metals will likely see the most upside. Bloxham noted that aside from clean energy metals, iron ore was also on his list due to falling inventory and a lack of investments into expanding capacity. Iron ore has seen a price jump of over 24% in the last year, according to data from FactSet. The benchmark 62%-grade iron ore last traded at $135.48 per ton. ""The reason why [iron ore] has a sudden squeeze-up is because inventory has been very low,"" said Bank of America Securities' head of Asia -Pacific basic materials, Matty Zhao. She noted that in spite of China's property crisis, steel production has continued, fueling demand for iron ore and coking coal, which are integral to steelmaking. China, which makes around 55% of the world's steel, produced 874.7 million tons of steel in the first 10 months of 2023 — up 1.4% across the same period in 2022.

In order to drive the progress and development of innovative solutions that tackle climate change and help the environment, there needs to be regulatory frameworks in place that help companies make bolder steps forward, top industry CEOs told CNBC. Ester Baiget, the CEO of biosolutions firm Novozymes, said that ""roadblocks"" usually stand in the way of companies producing sustainable solutions which needed to be removed. ""We need to work more with authorities to create the framework that we can move bolder … faster,"" Baiget said on an ""IOT: Powering the digital economy"" panel moderated by CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""We have a regulation which is based on the past,"" she added, pointing out that in her own sector it can take six years to register a new microbe (or microorganism) to replace fertilizers, for example.

Microbes have been put forward as an alternative to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The runoff from these synthetic fertilizers can also cause damage to waterways. However, new microbial fertilizers need to go through regulatory approval before going to market.

Rethinking regulation

During the same panel discussion last week, Ilham Kadri, the CEO of chemical science company Syensqo , also highlighted the issues with current regulation around sustainability. She said that ""the road to carbon neutrality is long, is costly, is not easy. We need to rethink regulation in regions like Europe."" Kadri also said there was a ""lack of competitiveness in Europe,"" referring to the difficulties faced by her sector.

"After earnings miss, Cramer says Tesla's out of the Magnificent Seven","After reviewing Tesla's earnings, CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday criticized CEO Elon Musk and told investors why he thinks the electric vehicle giant has lost its spot among the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks.

""As someone who was among the first to vocalize the Magnificent Seven rubric, I officially acknowledge now that there are only six left,"" he said.

Tesla's Wednesday report missed Wall Street's expectations and warned of a slowdown in 2024, sending its stock plummeting, down 12% by Thursday's close.

To Cramer, there are a number of factors revealed during earnings that alienate Tesla from its magnificent peers — Apple , Nvidia , Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet and Meta — including the fact that the company predicted ""notably"" slower growth this year. Tesla also faces intense competition from Chinese competitors, and Musk admitted that without trade barriers, these foreign manufacturers will ""pretty much demolish most other companies."" And according to Cramer, the other six aren't hostage to the performance of the broader economy, while Tesla purported many customers can't afford its vehicles.

Cramer also criticized Tesla's leadership, saying top management of great companies show they're committed to the success of their enterprise. Musk, however, indicated he doesn't want to grow the company's artificial intelligence and robotics sector unless he has more influence. Musk is asking for 25% voting control, nearly double his current stake. Cramer was also not pleased with Musk's earnings call reassurance that this larger stake wouldn't be so much ""that I can control the company even if I go bonkers.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

""Oh, thank heavens, you don't have a Magnificent Seven CEO who might go bonkers and, more important, what if he doesn't get his 25% voting power?"" Cramer asked. ""Does he take his bat and his ball, along with his artificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut, and go home?""","['miss', 'teslas', 'musk', 'earnings', 'cramer', 'robotics', 'seven', 'tesla', 'voting', 'magnificent', 'stake']",CNBC
Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,"Pat Gelsinger, CEO Intel, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 16th, 2024.

Intel shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.

Here's how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:

Earnings per share : 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected

: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected

For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that the core businesses — PC and server chips — would be at the low end of the the company's seasonal range in the current quarter, but that overall sales would take a hit because of weakness in subsidiaries including Mobileye and its programmable chip unit, as well as revenue decreases from other businesses the company has spun off or sold.

""The core business we see as healthy,"" Gelsinger said. ""We see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger.""

Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.

With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel's gross margin was 40%, down 2.6 percentage points annually.

Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.

Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia's recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.

""The data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters,"" said Intel CFO David Zinsner on a call with analysts on Thursday.

Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.

""The quarter capped a year of tremendous progress on Intel's transformation,"" Gelsinger said in a statement. Intel said on Thursday that it would restate past results under a new system where Intel has to account for costs related to internal manufacturing of its own chips.

Intel Foundry Services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.

Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Zinsner said that Intel had cut $3 billion in costs last year and the company spun off or sold five different business lines.

Intel's largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.

Gelsinger said that demand for PC chips had ""normalized,"" and that sales were strong in the gaming and commercial sectors. He added that Intel expects the total PC market to expand this year.

Intel's second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel's Network and Edge department, which sells parts for carriers and networking, reported $1.5 billion in sales, down 24% from last year.

Zinsner said that Intel expected its Data Center business to decline ""double-digit"" percentages sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.

Intel said it paid $3.1 billion in dividends in 2023.

TAIPEI — ""One day, we'll get our victory,"" Ko Wen-je, the vanquished presidential candidate for the Taiwan People's Party, said at his concession speech two weeks ago. He urged his disappointed young supporters, some of them crying, not to give up, and framed himself as a one-man social movement crusading for political change. ""For me, over the last 10 years, whether I was in office or standing for election, I have always regarded it as a social movement aimed at changing political culture. Since this social movement has not fully materialized, let's keep working hard,"" the former Taipei City Mayor told supporters in Mandarin. While he may have finished last in the first competitive three-way race for the Taiwan presidency since 2000, Ko garnered more than a quarter of the popular vote — disrupting the usual stranglehold of the dominant political parties, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and Kuomintang. The 63-year-old clearly resonated with the young and educated as he spoke plainly into their everyday bread-and-butter issues, including soaring housing costs and stagnant wages at a time of high inflation. ""We need to take Ko's rise very seriously,"" Wei-Ting Yen, an assistant professor in government at Franklin and Marshall College, told CNBC. ""There is a clear social base rooting for him and willing to support his populist discourse. These are anti-establishment attitudes. Is Taiwan seeing the rise of populism?""

These shades of populism, along with his shifting political affiliations in the past, contrast against Ko's self-association with the conviction and idealism of youth-led social movements in Taiwan. A populist, often seen as anti-establishment and anti-elitism, can sometimes be deemed a threat to democracy; Ko has paradoxically aligned himself to past social movements in Taiwan that have enhanced the island's nascent democracy. Once a leading organ transplant surgeon in Taiwan, Ko went from being aligned with the DPP in 2014 when he entered the race as an independent running for the Taipei mayorship, to nearly entering an alliance with main opposition party KMT in the most recent presidential election.

Taiwan's young and restless

In any case, Taiwan's two major parties now face a battle to cater to younger voters that could come at the expense of older votes or a focus on broader strategic interests. ""My sense is that Ko's personality and affect — his bluntness and willingness to criticize the existing parties, his position as a political outsider, etc.— appeal to people who feel disengaged with the traditional parties,"" said Sara Newland, an assistant professor in government at Smith College. ""He has also given voice to and amplified the idea that both the KMT and the DPP are ignoring the main domestic concerns of voters, and that kind of populist messaging appeals to people who feel like Taiwan's current economic and political system is not benefiting them,"" she added.

In the final My Formosa poll released before a ban on opinion polls kicked in prior to Election Day, 53.7% of respondents aged 20-29 indicated they would vote Ko for president. Overall, 21.8% of all respondents in that poll indicated they would vote for Ko — lower than the eventual 26.46% of the popular vote he earned at the Jan. 13 election. A similar breakdown on the election outcome was not immediately available. ""Even though the DPP emerged out of the underground pro-democracy movement under martial law, young people now see them as traditional and part of the political establishment,"" Newland said.

Political opportunism

Even though Ko lost the presidential race to Lai Ching-te from the ruling DPP, the Taiwan People's Party — founded only in 2019 — won eight seats in the 113-seat Legislative Yuan and now holds the balance of power when the new parliament take office Feb. 1. In a split parliament where the two major parties do not have a clear majority, one of them will need to form a coalition government with TPP.

The KMT, Beijing's preferred political partner, has 52 seats. The ruling DPP has 51, while independents hold the remaining two. Ko's party is ""ideologically nebulous,"" said Ming-sho Ho, a sociology professor at National Taiwan University who studies the working class and social movements. ""Ko once vowed to follow Tsai Ing-wen's foreign policy, but at the same time maintained that 'both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family' — these things just don't add up,"" he said, referring to the island's incumbent Democratic president from the DPP. ""Ko is indeed opportunistically arguing different things at the same time.""

The DPP has rejected the so-called ""1992 Consensus"" — a tacit agreement between the then-KMT government and Chinese Communist Party officials that China and Taiwan belong to ""one China,"" and the basis of Beijing's approach to cross-Straits engagement. China has never relinquished its claim over Taiwan — which has been self-governing since the Chinese nationalist party, or Kuomintang, fled to the island following its defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949. Chinese President Xi Jinping regards reunification with the mainland as ""a historical inevitability.""

Ko's association with Taiwan's recent history of activism — driven by young people and civil society — could therefore be deemed opportunistic. From the Wild Lily and Wild Strawberry movements to the Sunflower movement, Taiwan's road to democracy and reform has been marked by student-led social movements in the last few decades. The Wild Lily movement in 1990 was seen as pivotal to the self-governing island's first direct, democratic presidential and legislative elections in 1996, while the Wild Strawberry movement in 2008 emerged out of a protest against alleged police violence and abuse of power.

Ho from the National Taiwan University pointed out that ""the Sunflower Movement was of course a consequential event that contributed to the DPP's victory in the 2014 local election and the 2016 presidential election. But as the time passed by, the effect waned."" During the Sunflower movement in 2014, young protesters temporarily took control of the national legislature in protest against a free trade agreement with China which the then-ruling KMT government tried to ratify in an undemocratic manner. Protesters feared the agreement would lead to a greater dependence on China. ""Nevertheless, I would say the core values that undergirded the Sunflower Movement — such as the assertion of Taiwanese identity, the rejection of incorporation into a China-centered economy, and young people's claim about rising inequalities — still remain till now,"" he said, adding that these values ""no longer empower the DPP."" While those same values may have driven TPP at this elections, Taiwanese have also voted for other third-party candidates in the past — but they often fall by the wayside, unable to break the rotating KMT-DPP grip on power.

"Probe into GM's Cruise finds poor leadership, culture issues at center of accident response","Culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership at General Motors' Cruise autonomous vehicle unit were at the center of regulatory oversights and coverup concerns that have plagued the company since October, according to the findings of a third-party probe.

The report addresses, in part, controversy that has swirled around Cruise since an Oct. 2 accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle. Results of the investigation, which reviewed whether Cruise representatives misled investigators or members of the media in discussing the incident, were published Thursday in a 105-page report.

Despite the findings, which pointed to widespread issues with company culture, the third-party probe found that the evidence to date ""does not establish that Cruise leadership or personnel intended to deceive or mislead regulators"" during briefings a day after the accident, according to a summary of the report released by Cruise.

Cruise remains under investigation by several entities, including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Several Cruise leaders and employees — most of whom are no longer employed by the company — attempted to show regulators a video of the incident, according to the findings, but were only able to do so in one of several initial meetings due to connection or ""video transmission issues."" Although the intent to share the information had been there, the report found, the Cruise representatives subsequently failed to properly inform some regulators or officials of everything that occurred.

""The problem is that when the video froze, literally and figuratively, the Cruise employees froze in the moment, and nobody thought to speak up and fill in the detail,"" a person close to the investigation told CNBC.

Some employees also failed to update or correct company statements that omitted such information and attempted to deflect blame on the human hit-and-run driver who initially struck the pedestrian.

The report outlines multiple instances in which then-CEO and co-founder Kyle Vogt, who resigned in late November, made the final calls to withhold information, specifically regarding media.","['culture', 'issues', 'findings', 'poor', 'information', 'cruise', 'center', 'probe', 'company', 'regulators', 'employees', 'report', 'finds', 'leadership', 'investigation', 'video', 'gms', 'response']",CNBC
WWE boss Vince McMahon accused of sexual assault and trafficking in new lawsuit,"TKO Executive Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon is seen during a ceremony announcing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has joined the Board of Directors for TKO at New York Stock Exchange on January 23, 2024 in New York City.

WWE boss Vince McMahon was accused in a graphic lawsuit Thursday of sexual assault, trafficking, and physical and emotional abuse of a woman who previously worked at the pro wrestling giant.

The suit by Janel Grant — which alleges McMahon directed her to have sex with a WWE ""superstar"" and other men — seeks to void a nondisclosure agreement Grant said she reached with McMahon in early 2022.

Grant's suit in U.S. District Court in Connecticut says the billionaire McMahon agreed to pay her $3 million as part of that deal, but ended up only paying her $1 million in exchange for her silence about his conduct.

In addition to McMahon, 78, the complaint names as defendants WWE and John Laurinaitis, the company's former head of talent relations and general manager.

The complaint comes six months after federal law enforcement agents executed a search warrant on McMahon and served him with a grand jury subpoena as part of an investigation into McMahon's payment of millions of dollars to multiple women, among them Grant, after allegations of sexual misconduct.

McMahon, who resigned from WWE leadership posts in mid-2022 amid an internal company investigation, only to return as its leader in early 2023, last March paid WWE $17.4 million to cover costs of a probe of those payouts by a law firm retained by the company.

McMahon is executive chairman of the board of TKO Group Holdings , which was formed last year by a merger of his wrestling company and the mix-martial arts company UFC. He owns a significant number of shares in TKO Group.

Grant's lawyer, Ann Callis, in a statement, said, ""Today's complaint seeks to hold accountable two WWE executives who sexually assaulted and trafficked Plaintiff Janel Grant, as well as the organization that facilitated or turned a blind eye to the abuse and then swept it under the rug.""

""She is an incredibly private and courageous person who has suffered deeply at the hands of Mr. McMahon and Mr. Laurinaitis,"" Callis said. ""Ms. Grant hopes that her lawsuit will prevent other women from being victimized. The organization is well aware of Mr. McMahon's history of depraved behavior, and it's time that they take responsibility for the misconduct of its leadership.""

A spokesman for McMahon said, ''This lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.""

""He will vigorously defend himself,"" the spokesman said.

A TKO Group spokesperson said, ""Mr. McMahon does not control TKO nor does he oversee the day-to-day operations of WWE.""

""While this matter pre-dates our TKO executive team's tenure at the company, we take Ms. Grant's horrific allegations very seriously and are addressing this matter internally,"" the TKO spokesperson said.

TKO Group on Tuesday announced that Netflix would pay $5 billion over 10 years to stream the WWE's flagship program ""Raw,"" and carry all other WWE shows and specials outside the United States.

A WWE spokesman and Laurinaitis did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Grant's suit.","['assault', 'boss', 'suit', 'company', 'spokesman', 'mr', 'wwe', 'sexual', 'accused', 'tko', 'mcmahon', 'vince', 'grant', 'million', 'lawsuit', 'trafficking']",CNBC

Baidu AI Cloud will be integrating its Ernie chatbot into Samsung's Galaxy S24 smartphones, allowing users to translate calls in real time, among other features.

Ernie is the Chinese tech giant's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence technology that's able to generate humanlike responses to users' prompts.

It comes a week after Samsung revealed its latest Galaxy S24 lineup with AI-powered features as the South Korean electronics giant attempts to overtake the likes of Apple 's newest iPhones with the technology.

""Now featuring Ernie's understanding and generation capabilities, the upgraded Samsung Note Assistant can translate content and also summarize lengthy content into clear, intelligently organized formats at the click of a button, streamlining the organization of extensive text,"" the firms said in a statement.

Samsung was not among the top 5 smartphone vendors in China.

Apple was the largest smartphone vendor in China by shipments in 2023, and captured 17.3% of market share in the country, IDC data on Thursday showed. Honor came in second place with 16.8% market share, followed by Vivo, Huawei and Oppo.

The Ernie 4.0 version was launched on October. Baidu claims it is the ""most powerful version of Ernie foundation model to date,"" with the full capabilities of understanding, generation, reasoning, and memory.","['baidus', 'users', 'translate', 'smartphones', 'ernie', 'understanding', 'samsungs', 'south', 'power', 'ai', 'galaxy', 's24', 'smartphone', 'version', 'chatbot', 'samsung']",CNBC
Religious trips will fuel India’s tourism boom — airlines are gearing up with record aircraft orders,"India's tourism sector is set for a boom as more travelers take trips around the country for religious purposes.

The South Asian country with the world's largest Hindu population could see an additional 50 million to 100 million tourists a year on account of the new Ram Mandir — a temple in the northern city of Ayodhya inaugurated on Monday — according to Jefferies.

This expected footfall in the new temple will be much higher than the annual numbers for the Taj Mahal (6.5 million) in India, Rome's Vatican City (9 million) and the Mecca in Saudi Arabia (20 million), the note showed.

Other religious sights in India such as the Tirupati Temple in Andhra Pradesh — 25 million visitors annually — and the Vaishno Devi Temple in Jammu and Kashmir — 8 million visitors per year — also hold a strong spiritual, historical and cultural significance in India, the investment bank said.

""Religious tourism is still the biggest segment of tourism in India … the creation of a new religious tourist centre (Ayodhya) with improved connectivity and infrastructure can create a meaningfully large economic impact,"" Jefferies highlighted.

Indian media reported that around half a million people visited the Ram temple on its opening day which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The YouTube broadcast of the opening ceremony on Modi's channel alone received more than 11 million views.

""The multiplier effect of travel is humongous. If it continues develop tourist destination including religious tourism, chances are that more and more people will come to visit India and it will even benefit on the foreign exchange side,"" said Nilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management.","['tourist', 'ram', 'opening', 'orders', 'boom', 'india', 'record', 'million', 'temple', 'gearing', 'visitors', 'trips', 'tourism', 'religious', 'inaugurated', 'indias', 'fuel', 'airlines']",CNBC

Lessons from a lifetime in investment,"Print this page

Looking back over my five and a half decades exploring investment and finance, I have to ask the inevitable question: what have I learned from it all?

The period has been marked by a welter of financial innovation, regulatory change, booms and busts, banking crises, geopolitical tension and much else besides. From this protracted drama it is hard to extract a set of simple coherent lessons for investors. Yet I believe that there are some eternal verities in investment and finance. They are often counterintuitive and not always aligned with conventional economic wisdom.

My early education in investment started in the great bull market of the late 1960s, in which a heady pace was set by the so-called Nifty Fifty growth stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. In the brief period I spent in the City of London, becoming a chartered accountant, I had the good fortune to be sent on the audit of the Imperial Tobacco pension fund. This was run by one of the great investment gurus of the postwar period, the actuary George Ross Goobey.

When Ross Goobey went to the Imperial fund in 1947, pension funds were mainly invested in gilt-edged securities, which were regarded as safer than equities. In his view this was a nonsense.

Against the consensus

His thinking, he told me, was not based on sophisticated economics or actuarial legerdemain. He merely thought that the Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton’s 2.5 per cent fixed interest gilts were a swindle when inflation was running at more than 4 per cent. They could not, he thought, deliver the requisite returns to meet Imperial’s pension obligations.

Equities, by contrast, looked to him absurdly cheap. Ross Goobey managed the remarkable feat of persuading the fund’s trustees to let him invest in equities and dump the fund’s gilts.

In the bull market conditions of the late 1960s the Imperial fund’s portfolio struck me as bafflingly cumbersome. It contained nearly 900 holdings in mainly small and medium-sized — far from nifty — quoted UK companies. The fund was stuck with them regardless of their performance because Ross Goobey insisted his managers should never trade, only buy and hold.

Particularly unfathomable to me was his injunction to his managers to buy nothing that yielded less than 6 per cent. In a raging bull market this ensured exposure to some of the shakiest companies on the London Stock Exchange.

A few went bust in the subsequent recession. Yet, thanks to the policy of extreme diversification, the portfolio damage was marginal. In addition the high-yield injunction protected the fund from exposure to the most overvalued (and thus low-yielding) companies in the boom.

Here was an object lesson in the workings of diversification, though not quite as envisaged by economists such as Harry Markowitz, for whom the “free lunch” of diversification came primarily from spreading bets across different asset classes. Ross Goobey instead took a very risky bet on a single asset class while diversifying within it. The risk of capital loss was mitigated by the yield discipline he imposed.

So great were the returns that Imperial enjoyed pension contribution holidays for years. Other institutional investors followed suit by dropping gilts in favour of ordinary shares. Ross Goobey was credited with founding what came to be known as “the cult of the equity”.

Among the enduring lessons: diversification is an invaluable risk management tool. High yield, though often an indicator of dividend cuts to come, can be a good defence in an overheated market; equating risk with volatility, as so many economists do, may be less helpful, especially for private investors, than focusing on avoiding loss of capital. Meanwhile, reducing transaction costs by minimising share trading bolsters investment performance. That logic has turbocharged the rise of passive investing.

A decade of financial turbulence

The 1970s provided me with an induction course, first on the Investors Chronicle and The Times, then as financial editor of The Economist, in the dynamics of booms and busts. The unintended consequences of deregulation — a recurring theme in financial markets — helped shape what proved in economic and financial terms to be an exceptionally violent decade.

Exhibit A in the saga was US President Nixon’s cancellation in 1971 of the convertibility of the dollar into gold. The resulting deregulation of exchange rates unleashed volatile cross-border capital flows that caused wild swings in global asset prices. Exhibit B was the shift in the banking system from being a home for low-risk, highly regulated quasi-utilities — a product of the troubled 1930s — to an adventure playground in which bankers’ insatiable risk appetite was substantially liberated.

A radical and still instructive deregulatory experiment took place in the UK in 1971. The Bank of England scrapped quantitative ceilings on bank lending in favour of indirect controls, such as balance sheet ratios. This unleashed a wild acceleration of the money supply and credit. Excess liquidity poured into an overheating property market. Then came the 1973 oil crisis, soaring inflation, recession and financial crisis. Property, gilts and equities all plunged.

In equities, the dramatic share price collapse was driven by financial institutions’ selling. Their fear was not ill-founded. In confronting inflation, the Conservative government of prime minister Edward Heath removed key props of the capitalist system by adopting price, dividend and commercial rent controls.

At the same time companies faced not only spiralling wage bills but penal tax liabilities. This was because corporation tax was charged on paper profits from stock appreciation, the difference between the original cost of inventory and the inflated cost of replacing it. Result: British industry was going bust.

When Labour replaced the Tories in early 1974 chancellor Denis Healey intensified the corporate fiscal clamp. Yet by the autumn he had grasped that the corporate sector was being terminally throttled. He introduced tax relief for stock appreciation along with other breaks.

Timing the market

Policy U-turns often signal market turnarounds. Healey’s move to put British capitalism back on its feet should have ended the bear market. Yet in the fourth quarter of 1974, fearful insurance companies, pension funds, investment trusts and unit trusts together sold more shares than they bought for the first and last time during the decade.

Then on January 6 1975, after a peak-to-trough fall on the FTSE All-Share index of 72.9 per cent, the market inexplicably turned and rose vertically. It was impossible for the institutions to get back into the market without causing prices to move spectacularly against themselves.

That is a reminder of the futility, for most investors, of trying to time the market and of the difficulty of contrarianism, the art of investing against the consensus. Note, though, that Ross Goobey, hitherto an equity ideologue, once again defied convention.

When undated gilt yields reached 17 per cent in the mid-1970s the Imperial fund took a big bet on these government IOUs. Ross Goobey’s thinking was that if inflation came down this was an unbelievable bargain. But if the economy was going to hell in a handcart all bets were off anyway.

Of course, all bets are never off in financial markets, not least because when that becomes the common perception, gold comes into its own. There lies the case for the yellow metal as a hedge against catastrophe.

Why should this episode resonate with us today? While economists have explained exhaustively that we are not now reliving the 1970s the similarities remain more striking than the differences. Both periods saw supply side energy and commodity shocks, together with surging money supply. Governments turned on the fiscal tap in response.

Central bankers in both periods initially declared they could do nothing to curb an inflation induced by supply shortages. They were slow to see the demand side of the equation and the risk of second round effects in labour markets. And 21st century central banks’ economic models provided useless forecasts when confronted with supply shocks. So they fell back on a shaky, data-dependent (in other words, backward-looking) monetary policy.

One lesson is that investors, as well as central bankers, ignore money supply signals at their peril. Another is that in such inflationary periods government bonds cease to provide a diversifying hedge against supposedly riskier assets.

Dotcom delirium

Fast forward, now, to the second half of the 1990s, by which time I had been writing for the FT for a decade and a half. The dotcom boom was turning into a bubble, once again making a nonsense of mainstream economists’ belief that markets are “efficient” or reflect fair market values.

An important psychological factor in the tech euphoria was “Fomo” (fear of missing out) which goes back in history at least as far as the South Sea Bubble of the early 18th century. Fomo adds to investors’ myopia over the risk of capital loss.

For professional investors fear of missing out is more a matter of business and career risk. They are usually benchmarked against an index or peer group. So if they stand against a bubble and underperform the index, clients defect and they may be fired.

This was the fate of Tony Dye, the former chief investment officer of Phillips & Drew Fund Management, during the tech bubble. By shunning overvalued tech and going heavily into cash he seriously underperformed PDFM’s peer group, leading to his ousting just two weeks before the bubble burst. Small wonder fund managers tend to hug their benchmarks.

Central banks responded to the dotcom bust with rapid interest rate cuts. This cemented a view in the markets that policy was asymmetric. That is, the central banks would never lean against a bubble and would reliably extend a safety net when it burst.

The moral hazard implicit in asymmetric policy helped pave the way for the wild credit bubble of the 2000s (see below). Then came the great financial crisis of 2007-09. The central banks’ response was once again to come to the rescue and keep interest rates ultra low for a decade while buying up government bonds and other assets via so-called “quantitative easing”. A further round of propping up followed the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

By the post-crash 2010s the UK investment scene had reverted to something like the pattern that confronted George Ross Goobey after the second world war. Pension funds had run down their equity holdings to near-zero. Quirky accounting standards and pressure from The Pensions Regulator had pushed them into liability-driven investment. Instead of seeking to maximise the return on their assets, trustees sought to match their liabilities by buying what economists and actuaries described as “safe” government bonds.

Yet nothing in investment is ever safe — witness how the collapse in US Treasuries contributed to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and other US regional banks last year. And the regulators’ attempts to make individual pension funds risk-free makes the overall market structure more risky: if everyone pursues the same strategy, when the market moves, it moves all one way. That eternal verity re-emerged in the pension fund crisis in the gilt market in 2022.

After a lifetime spent watching the markets, I am struck how, with each new cycle in which central banks act as lenders of last resort, debt mounts inexorably. We continue to muddle through. But a great debt denouement is inevitable because debt cannot rise faster than incomes for ever.

Since debt implosions are inherently deflationary — see Japan in the 1990s — gold, ever resilient against inflation, may not provide insurance against falling prices but government bonds certainly will. To conclude; it is tempting to quote the US economist Herbert Stein who remarked that if something can’t go on forever, then it will stop. But as I have remarked here before, the wise rejoinder by fellow economist Rudi Dornbusch was: yes, but it will go on for a lot longer than you anticipate.","['goobey', 'lifetime', 'lessons', 'fund', 'investment', 'financial', 'investors', 'risk', 'market', 'funds', 'pension', 'ross']",Financial Times
Intel seen struggling to ‘find its footing’ as guidance miss sends stock tanking,"Intel Corp.’s stock hasn’t seen a double-digit percentage decline in more than two years. But it might break that streak after a downbeat earnings forecast.

The company late Thursday issued an outlook for first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents on revenue of $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion. Both forecasts came up well shy of the FactSet consensus: Analysts had been modeling 34 cents in adjusted EPS along with revenue of $14.3 billion.

“While we expect a slightly sub-seasonal first quarter from our core product businesses, we see material inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG,” Intel INTC, +0.94% Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner said on the earnings call, referring to the Programmable Solutions Group.

Furthermore, the company anticipates “a significant drop in [Intel Foundry Services] revenue after seeing accelerated purchasing in our traditional packaging business and cyclical weakness in wafer equipment-buying in the first half of the year,” he continued.

Intel’s stock fell 10.9% in after-hours action Thursday. If such a decline carried through to Friday’s close, it would mark the stock’s worst single-day percentage decline since Oct. 22, 2021, when it fell 11.7%, according to Dow Jones Market Data. After that, the worst drop was an 8.6% plunge seen July 29, 2022.

“We think Intel shares are justifiably selling off following soft [first-quarter] guidance that leaves us to question when the company will find its footing as competitors capitalize on an ongoing AI server [capital-expenditure] cycle,” Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note to clients.

The guidance miss comes as Intel’s stock has enjoyed a nice recent rally, surging about 50% since the company last posted results three months ago. The recent run in the share price “raised the bar on expectations,” an HSBC analyst wrote earlier this week.

Intel’s whiff on the outlook overshadowed better-than-expected results for the latest quarter, in which the company generated net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents a share, versus a loss of about $700 million, or 16 cents a share, in the year-prior period. On an adjusted basis, Intel earned 54 cents a share, while analysts were modeling 45 cents a share.

“We expect to unlock further efficiencies in 2024 and beyond as we implement our new internal foundry model, which is designed to drive greater transparency and accountability and higher returns on our owners’ capital,” Zinsner said in a release.

Revenue climbed to $15.4 billion from $14.0 billion, whereas the FactSet consensus called for $15.2 billion.

Intel saw a 33% boost in revenue, to $8.8 billion, from its client-computing group, which is the company’s largest unit and the one that encompasses PCs. Analysts had been modeling $8.5 billion.

Revenue from the data-center and artificial-intelligence group was down 10% to $4.0 billion, while analysts were looking for $4.1 billion.

The company’s network and edge business saw a 24% drop in revenue, to $1.5 billion, relative to a year before. That total matched the FactSet consensus.

Meanwhile, Mobileye revenue increased 13% to $637 million, and foundry services revenue jumped 63% to $291 million.

The culprit? A slowdown in U.S. volumes into January, according to analysts.

Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev noted that Visa’s V, +0.35% U.S. payment volumes decelerated in the fiscal first quarter and in the first three weeks of January, a trend driven by debit transactions.

Visa

Baird analyst David Kallo said that while the deceleration in January U.S. volumes and total processed transactions was “not a huge surprise,” those trends could cause the stock to “pull back mildly tomorrow.”

Visa Chief Financial Officer Chris Suh said the January U.S. trends reflected one-off factors that weren’t indicative of broader spending issues. For example, areas like Kansas City and Dallas have seen extreme cold temperatures that have prevented people from going out and spending.

“We’ve seen weather-related patterns before,” he said. “It doesn’t give us major concern.”

As for the December-quarter volume trends, he said the slowdown was a matter of timing.

“Putting it all together, the step-down of about 80 basis points in total U.S. payments volume growth from Q4 to Q1 was primarily due to a less favorable mix of weekends and weekdays,” he said on Visa’s earnings call.

“Consumer spend across all segments from low to high spend has remained relatively stable,” he continued. “Our data does not indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments.”

Investors, though, still seemed concerned, and shares fell nearly 3% in after-hours trading Thursday.

For the fiscal first quarter, Visa posted net income of $4.9 billion, or $2.39 a share, compared with net income of $4.2 billion, or $1.99 a share, in the year-prior period. After adjustments, Visa earned $2.41 a share, beating the FactSet consensus view, which was for $2.34 a share.

Revenue rose to $8.63 billion from $7.94 billion, whereas analysts had been looking for $8.56 billion.

The company saw an 8% boost in payments volume during the latest quarter, while processed transactions rose by 9%.

Consumer spending has been “resilient” and “quite stable,” Suh said.

The company saw a 16% boost in volume from cross-border transactions, which take place when someone makes a purchase from a merchant based in a different country. Cross-border volume typically is seen as a proxy for international travel, though it also encompasses international e-commerce purchases.

“Travel contunues to be a tailwind” and is “quite healthy,” Suh told MarketWatch.

For the fiscal second quarter, Visa expects net revenue to grow at an “upper-mid” to high-single-digit rate. The company also expects earnings per share to grow at a “high-teens” pace from a year before.

The company is sticking with its full-year forecast, which calls for low-double-digit revenue growth on an adjusted constant-dollar basis.

Fiscal 2024 could be “a little bit of a mirror image of 2023 in the sense that our first-half revenue growth rate, even if the fundamentals are very stable…will be compressed just because of the high comparables a year ago, and we see lots of reasons why the second-half-of-the-year growth rates will accelerate,” Suh told MarketWatch.

The company faces easier comparisons in the second half of the year, he said, and management expects to see favorable trends in average ticket sizes.

"Levi Strauss to lay off up to 15% of corporate workforce, stock slides as profit forecast disappoints","With new leadership coming in after difficult 2023, Levi Strauss & Co. on Thursday announced plans to lay off staff and cut costs over the next few years — part of a multi-year “global productivity initiative” that didn’t do much for the iconic jeans-maker’s share price following a disappointing profit forecast.

Levi Strauss LEVI, +0.19% said it would lay off between 10% and 15% of its global corporate staff in the first half of this year. Executives said they expected the initiative to save $100 million in costs in its fiscal 2024, which ends in November.

The cuts and savings plan came as Chief Executive Chip Bergh prepares to depart from that role and hand the reins to Michelle Gass, who will take over on Jan. 29. Levi’s is also trying to sell more of its own denim directly to shoppers via its own physical stores and online sales network, as outside chain retailers remain cautious on stocking up too much on new clothing following nearly two years of muted demand.

“We have a strong pipeline of newness and innovation launching this year to fuel consumer demand,” Gass said in Levi Strauss’s fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday. “And I am confident in the significant growth opportunities ahead for this company — including accelerating international growth, becoming a denim-apparel lifestyle business, and leading with” Levi’s direct-to-consumer business.

Still, shares fell 2.5% after hours, after management forecast full-year adjusted per-share profit that was below Wall Street’s expectations.

Levi’s said it expected to earn $1.15 to $1.25 for its full year. That was below FactSet forecasts for $1.33. The company expects full-year sales growth of 1% to 3%.

Levi’s results — and the roadmap it laid out for better profits — follow a host of other companies that have announced job cuts this month, as more companies look to guard their profit margins. Levi’s operating margins in the fourth quarter rose to 9.2% from 8.6% in the same quarter in 2022.

The plans also echoed those that sneaker and athletic gear-maker Nike Inc. announced in December. Nike NKE, +0.01% said it would seek up to $2 billion in cost cuts over the next three years. And it said it was leaning on “newness and innovation” to attract shoppers who, due to higher prices for necessities, haven’t been as eager to spend a lot on new shoes and clothes. One analyst said that strategy wasn’t working.

Levi’s has been hoping its bigger brand-name will help it overcome those difficulties. For the fourth quarter, the company reported sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% year over year. Levi’s reported adjusted earnings per share of 44 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet expected Levi’s to report adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents, on revenue of $1.66 billion.

Its direct-to-consumer sales — or sales from its own stores and e-commerce — jumped 11% in the fourth quarter. Those sales made up a slightly bigger chunk of overall revenue, at 42%, than during the same quarter in 2022.

However, wholesale revenues — or the sales Levi’s gets when retailers buy its clothing and sell it to people shopping in their stores — fell 2%. In that segment, management said “growth of the Levi’s brands in the U.S. and Asia was offset by a decline in Europe.”

Opinion: Intel is struggling to gain traction in AI chips while Nvidia and AMD roar ahead,"It’s a tale of two worlds for Intel INTC, +0.94% these days. At a turbulent time for the silicon industry, the computer-chip giant late Thursday reported that fourth-quarter 2023 revenue rose 10% year over year, with a gross margin increase of 6.5 points. For the 2023 full-year results, however, total revenue was down 14% vs. 2022 and total gross margin slipped to 40% from 42.6%.

Compared to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM, +0.03% or even Nvidia NVDA, +0.42% , with 2023 gross margins of 54% and 73% respectively, Intel continues to struggle to find ways to manage costs.

But looking at the overall quarterly or full-year 2023 results doesn’t tell the whole story. Intel’s two most important business units, CCG (client products) and DCAI (data center and AI infrastructure products) could not be on more divergent paths.

The client group at Intel is the cash cow, the part of the company that has continuously provided the revenue and dollars to operate and grow new business units and product lines. Looking at client group operations in last year’s fourth quarter, things look amazing. Revenue was up 33% and operating income jumped more than 450%, with operating income increasing from $500 million to $2.9 billion compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company called out “healthier alignment” to the inventory situation that was the cause for concern over the past couple of years as one of the primary reasons for the turnaround.

This paints 2024 as a potential growth opportunity for client products, inclusive of laptop and desktop CPU chips. Intel launched its new chips, called Core Ultra, for the AI PC market last month, with some systems from partners including Dell and HP available before the holiday, and many more coming this quarter. Intel’s ability to grow its client group earnings is strongly contingent on momentum and consumer excitement over adopting PCs with this new AI capability.

Many industry analysts are calling for a “supercycle” of PC upgrades in the second half of 2024 as more software and interesting consumer use cases move AI computing from the cloud to your local PC. For now, I see AI PC demand as rather soft. Looking at the enthusiast technology audience, one I general consider the leading indicator of technology trends, there is very little interest in “AI for AI’s sake” and instead I see a sense of patience for that “wow” moment to trigger the buying cycle. I’m confident it will happen.

Intel isn’t the only player in this AI PC space. Both AMD AMD, +1.14% and Qualcomm QCOM, +0.06% have very good chips with integrated AI accelerators, and interesting startups like MemryX offer add-on AI chips, so Intel will have to compete on performance and flex its channel-influence muscle to create the best software ecosystem for its parts in order to stand out.

“We are past the point of simply shrugging it off with a ‘better luck next time’ mentality. ”

If this past quarter’s results offer a lot of optimism for the client side of Intel’s house, then they bring an equal amount of questions for the data-center and AI infrastructure business unit. Revenue dropped year over year by 10% and operating income was down 38%, with an operating margin of 2%.

The company commented in a press release that the “CPU addressable market” was contracting and that there were significant competitive pressures on earnings. Yet we are past the point of simply shrugging it off with a “better luck next time” mentality. Intel’s Xeon CPU is still the dominant market-share leader in the data-center CPU chip space, even with the likes of AMD and its Epyc line of parts making inroads. But that clearly isn’t enough to grow the business.

Intel’s data-center group is having issues executing on a plan to capitalize on the AI computing craze. While Nvidia stock skyrockets to a $1.5 trillion valuation, Intel’s data-center GPU products haven’t gained a foothold. And while the Gaudi line of AI accelerators looks good on paper and in the limited benchmarks available, there’s no significant bellwether design wins or partnerships that indicate a flood of sales will be happening anytime soon.

Considering AMD is projecting revenue from its MI300 AI server chip into the billions of dollars for 2024, it’s incredibly concerning that Intel isn’t showing a plan to counter. The company announced a leadership change for this business unit this month, and while a needed move, it is not an instant band-aid to solve the AI issues Intel has.

Read: Missed the boat on AMD’s stock surge? Why this analyst says you’re not too late.

During Intel’s earnings call Q&A, CEO Pat Gelsinger indicated that Intel’s focus for AI in 2024 will be more on AI inference than training, activating and using the AI models rather than creating or building new ones. If the market is moving that way and needs to adopt a slightly different infrastructure base for that to happen, it will lean more to Intel’s strengths.

Additionally, Intel CFO David Zinsner told analysts on Thursday that there is a “$2 billion pipeline” for its “discrete accelerator portfolio” for 2024. This is a positive sign that Intel could still make headway in the data center AI space this year with its Gaudi product. A pipeline is not the same as official revenue projections or a much-needed customer announcement, but it’s a more positive sign than anything that appeared in the company’s earnings statements.

The once vaunted network and edge business unit (NEX) at the company saw revenue drop 24% year over year and operating income drop to a rounding error of zero. And the foundry services business (IFS) increases revenue to $291 million (up 63% year over year) but is still bleeding money as the company spends capital in new facilities and partnerships.

This year is going to be telling for Intel and how it will move forward into the second half the decade. Can this once-unassailable tech giant get back on its feet with Gelsinger’s help and offer both manufacturing and product excellence? Or will it continue to get beaten down by Nvidia, AMD or even Qualcomm — companies that until recently were just flies buzzing around its head?

"U.K. consumers feeling brighter as year starts, with inflation trending down","U.K. consumers continue to feel cheerier as 2024 starts, according to a survey released Friday.

Research group GfK’s Consumer Confidence Barometer rose three points to minus-19, its highest level in two years. The reading was a little better than the minus-20 expected by economists, according to a poll carried out by the Wall Street Journal.

All components of the barometer rose over the month, including sentiment on the general economic situation ahead, and confidence on making major purchases. Particularly exciting is the measure of respondents’ feelings on their personal financial situation for the coming 12 months, GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said, with the index moving out of negative territory for the first time in two years.

“This significant change is the best single indicator for how the nation’s households feel about their income and expenditure,” Staton said.

“Despite the cost-of-living crisis still impacting many households across the U.K., consumers appear to be encouraged by the positive news about falling inflation,” Staton said. “Let’s see if this optimism continues.”

Consumer prices ticked a little higher in December, though economists expect the rate of inflation to resume its fall in the months ahead.

An increase in household spending would offer a much-needed boost to the U.K. economy as the year begins. Retail sales were weak for much of the latter part of 2023, including the key December period, and economists expect a tough start to 2024 for the wider economy.","['trending', 'rose', 'situation', 'economists', 'consumers', 'starts', 'little', 'months', 'brighter', 'staton', 'uk', 'including', 'inflation', 'feeling', 'households']",MarketWatch
Opinion: Intel stock plunge shows Wall Street still hasn’t learned its lesson on AI hype,"Intel Corp.’s disappointing forecast for the first quarter includes another anticipated double-digit decline in the company’s data-center business, as the chip maker has yet to capitalize on its AI opportunity.

Since its third-quarter earnings, Intel’s stock INTC, +0.94% has surged about 50%, in part due to the potential of providing chips for artificial intelligence. One analyst said in November that Intel represented a potential “under-the-radar AI opportunity.” But on Thursday, its shares tumbled about 11% after hours on its lower-than-expected forecast for the first quarter.

The data center is where Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.42% has been cleaning up with its graphics unit processors (GPUs) designed for AI training and inference applications. Nvidia’s data-center business grew nearly 280% in its fiscal third quarter, as it continues to see nonstop demand for its GPUs to accelerate AI applications.

Intel Chief Financial Officer Dave Zinsner told analysts Thursday, though, that the company has a $2 billion pipeline for its accelerator product line, code-named Gaudi, a chip that is expected to compete with Nvidia. The next iteration, Gaudi 3, is expected to launch sometime in 2024, but CEO Pat Gelsinger did not give any specifics on timing.

“While the data center has seen some wallet-share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters, we expect growth in CPU compute cores to return to more normal historical rates and our discrete accelerator portfolio, with well over $2 billion in pipeline, to gain traction as we move through 2024,” Zinsner said Thursday.

Marbel Lopez, principal analyst at Lopez Research, said she believes Intel’s AI story is not going to kick in until the third quarter. “Inferencing is Intel’s strength and where they can win,” she said. “It’s just a longer-term game.”

Some analysts are more skeptical. Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deep Water Asset Management, told CNBC after Intel’s call that he does not believe Intel is going to get the big lift from AI that it is hoping for. “There are better ways to play the AI silicon opportunity,” he said.

Lucas Keh, an analyst at Third Bridge, said in a note to clients that he believed Intel’s new products are coming out at a slower-than-expected pace, and that software is one of the bottlenecks. He said investors were disappointed with a slower-than-expected product ramp.

“It also brings the new question of where exactly cloud players’ appetite are for Nvidia alternatives outside of their own custom silicon developments,” Keh said.

In addition to the data center, Intel also has opportunity in the PC space, where it believes that new, AI-ready PCs with Intel chips that can compute AI queries on the device instead of the cloud, will begin to take off starting in the second quarter and running through the second half of 2024.

But the lesson here is that investors got a bit ahead of themselves on Intel’s AI story, and a reminder that there is still a lot of hope surrounding AI — but not every company has concrete numbers yet.

GM is facing a Justice Department investigation into the gruesome Cruise robotaxi collision that critically injured a pedestrian in San Francisco,"General Motors is facing a U.S. Justice Department investigation into a gruesome collision that critically injured a pedestrian and derailed its self-driving car ambitions.

The Justice Department inquiry disclosed in a report Thursday is the latest twist in a debacle that began in October after a robotaxi operated by GM’s Cruise subsidiary dragged a pedestrian about 20 feet (6 meters) after the person was struck in San Francisco by another vehicle driven by a human.

The incident resulted in Cruise’s license to operate its driverless fleet in California being suspended by regulators and triggered a purge of its leadership — in addition to layoffs that jettisoned about a quarter of its workforce — as GM curtailed its once-lofty ambitions in self-driving technology. Cruise’s omission of key details about what happened in the Oct. 2 incident also led to allegations of a coverup that could result in a fine of $1.5 million. Cruise has offered to pay $75,000 instead.

GM didn’t release any details about the nature of the Justice Department’s investigation, or of another one by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A company spokesman would only say GM is cooperating with authorities.

The revelations about the latest troubles facing Detroit-based GM and San Francisco-based Cruise came in a report reviewing how things were handled after the pedestrian was hurt.

The report prepared by the law firm of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan rebuked Cruise’s management that has since been dumped for “poor leadership, mistakes in judgment, lack of coordination, an ‘us versus them’ mentality with regulators.” But the report also asserted that Cruise initially thought it had shown California regulators a video that included segments showing a robotaxi named “Panini” dragging the pedestrian, only to discover later that scene hadn’t been seen because of internet streaming issues.

The report blamed Cruise for having a “myopic focus” on protecting its reputation instead of setting the record straight after management realized regulators hadn’t seen the video of the incident in its entirety.

“Cruise must take decisive steps to address these issues in order to restore trust and credibility,” according to the report’s summary findings.

GM has already installed a new management team at Cruise and walked back its goals for a driverless division that was supposed to transform the transportation industry by operating robotic ride-hailing services across the U.S. Even as skeptics raised doubts about whether autonomous driving technology had become reliable enough to realize that vision, GM was projecting Cruise would generate $1 billion in revenue by 2025 — 10 times the amount it had been bringing in during a ramp-up phase that resulted in billions of dollars in losses.

Cruise had cleared a significant hurdle last August when California regulators approved its request to begin operating its robotaxi service throughout San Francisco at all hours — over the strenuous objections of city officials — only to have it all unravel in early October.","['gruesome', 'facing', 'cruise', 'management', 'justice', 'regulators', 'report', 'pedestrian', 'san', 'investigation', 'incident', 'injured', 'robotaxi', 'francisco', 'gm']",Fortune
"4,700 U.S. auto dealers urge President Biden to ‘hit the brakes’ on EPA push on stricter vehicle-pollution standards","More than 4,700 auto dealerships across the United States urged President Joe Biden in a letter Thursday to halt the Environmental Protection Agency’s efforts to enforce stricter vehicle-pollution standards.

The missive comes just weeks before the agency’s expected ruling on its tailpipe-emissions proposal, which addresses both climate change and pollutants that are harmful to health.

It is the second letter that auto dealers have sent to the White House in two months on the EPA’s upcoming ruling, which could codify the agency’s strictest-ever tailpipe emissions limits, proposed last April. The dealerships said Thursday that the Biden administration did not respond to their first letter sent on Nov. 28.

An EPA spokesperson said the agency cannot comment as the proposal is currently in the interagency review process.

“President Biden is investing in a future that is made in America by American workers as we position the United States to lead the clean energy future,” a White House spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. “More Americans are buying EVs every day—with EV sales rising faster than traditional gas-powered cars—as the President’s Inflation Reduction Act makes EVs more affordable and helps Americans save money when driving.”

With the world focused on trying to limit warming to no more than 1.5-degree Celsius temperature above pre-industrial times, the administration has an ambitious goal to cut domestic planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. Part of its focus is on the transportation sector, 58% of the emissions from which come from passenger cars and trucks, according to the EPA. The regulation also limits hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter into the air. These emissions cause a host of health issues and disproportionately affect people who live near heavy traffic.

The EPA says its proposed regulations could mean that up to two out of every three vehicles sold in the U.S. are electric by 2032. That’s higher than the administration’s target of 50% set two years ago.

The regulations, which impact light- and medium-duty vehicles beginning with the 2027 model year, could mean a 56% drop in projected greenhouse gas emissions from the fleet, relative to existing standards, avoiding nearly 7.3 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions by 2055. They also reduce pollutants harmful to health by 60% from the existing standard by model year 2032.

Most automakers around the globe have pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to transition to all-electric new vehicle sales in the coming decade as momentum to address climate change builds. Last year, U.S. EV sales overall grew 47% to a record 1.2 million, according to Motorintelligence.com. EVs are seeing year-over-year growth, but only hit 7.6% of overall market share in 2023.

Given that, thousands of auto dealers say they won’t be able to meet the EPA’s stringent goals.

Nearly 4,000 dealerships of the nearly 17,000 franchised shops nationwide asked Biden to “tap the brakes” on the EPA proposal in the November letter, referring to the rules as an “electric vehicle mandate.” House Republicans approved a bill in December to block the pollution limits and also called the rules a mandate.

In this week’s letter, the dealerships asked Biden to “hit the brakes” entirely, citing several factors that they say indicate slowing EV adoption. The signers said the supply of EVs on dealer lots is twice that of internal combustion engine vehicles, and that they won’t be able to sell EVs at the rate the regulations would require.

“It is uncontestable that the combination of fewer tax incentives, a woefully inadequate charging infrastructure, and insufficient consumer demand makes the proposed electric vehicle mandate completely unrealistic,” the letter says.

The EPA’s tailpipe-pollution limits wouldn’t require automakers to sell a specific number of EVs every year.

Automakers can meet EPA regulations not just through pure-electric vehicle sales, but also through a sales mix including hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, plus cleaner internal-combustion engine vehicles. The EPA has also said that the auto industry could employ widespread use of particulate filters, which mitigate the soot emitted from conventional gasoline-fueled engines.

“In order to stay on track to meeting overall climate policy goals that have been adopted by the country, I think it’s important to be aggressive in this sector where you have the technology, progress is being made, there’s momentum in markets,” said Jessika Trancik, a professor in energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “This can be a really important part of the overall effort to reach 2030 and ultimately, 2050 emissions reduction targets.

“There are a number of different ways you can improve efficiencies and reduce emissions,” Trancik added. But, “If you want to meet those targets, fully electric vehicles are probably going to be a really important tool, at least in part, to allow for that because they do offer the greatest emissions cuts.”

The EPA is also proposing regulations for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and the government’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has separately proposed a fuel-economy increase.","['biden', 'brakes', 'emissions', 'evs', 'vehicle', 'sales', 'hit', 'push', 'stricter', 'regulations', 'president', 'epa', 'letter', 'vehicles', 'vehiclepollution', 'dealers', 'standards', 'urge', 'electric']",Fortune
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is meeting the world’s top two producers of memory chips as he reportedly fundraises for his own semiconductor plants,"OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman is visiting leaders of South Korea’s semiconductor industry this week, as the artificial-intelligence pioneer weighs an ambitious move into chip production.

Altman, who arrived in Seoul Thursday evening, is touring Samsung Electronics Co.’s chip fabrication plants in Pyeongtaek on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter. He’ll meet the top executive of Samsung’s semiconductor business, as well as divisional heads of the foundry, memory and system LSI units, said the person, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. He is also scheduled to meet the CEO of rival SK Hynix Inc. and SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won to discuss ways to collaborate, the person said.

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT more than a year ago, interest in AI applications has skyrocketed, spurring massive demand for the computing power and processors needed to build and run those AI programs. Altman has repeatedly said there already aren’t enough chips for his company’s needs.

It’s not clear what the goals of Altman’s Korea trip are. He has been working to raise billions of dollars to set up a network of factories to manufacture semiconductors, Bloomberg News reported this month. Samsung has been expanding its foundry business, which manufactures chips to the designs of its customers.

Representatives for Samsung and SK Hynix declined to comment. OpenAI representatives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

South Korea is a leader in high-end chip production, dominating the market with Taiwan. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is the leading foundry in the world, crafting chips for the likes of Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp.

The Korean government this month outlined a blueprint involving investment of 622 trillion won ($466 billion) from the private sector in the years leading up to 2047. They will spend the money to build 13 new chip plants and three research facilities, on top of an existing 21 fabs. Spanning Pyeongtaek to Yongin, the area is expected to be the largest in the world, capable of producing 7.7 million wafers monthly by 2030.

The world’s two biggest memory chipmakers are trying to build their most sophisticated chip plants at home. Samsung is betting big on the foundry expansion as part of a 500 trillion won investment by 2047. SK Hynix aims to invest 122 trillion won in memory in Yongin over the same period.","['plants', 'openai', 'reportedly', 'semiconductor', 'samsung', 'person', 'sam', 'meeting', 'sk', 'won', 'producers', 'memory', 'fundraises', 'worlds', 'foundry', 'trillion', 'chip']",Fortune

A global coffee miller has announced plans to shut its operations in Kenya next month as the bungled government-backed reforms in the coffee sector continue to disrupt the industry.

NKG Coffee Mills Kenya, a member of Germany’s Neumann Kaffee Gruppe, says it will lay off staff by the end of February, citing recent regulatory changes in the industry, after the implementation of the Coffee Regulations, 2019 and Capital Markets (Coffee Exchange) Regulations, 2020.

“Following these changes, NKG Coffee Mills Kenya Ltd has not been able to secure the milling license and it is in this regard that the company has taken the decision to close the milling operations. In these ongoing changes, there is a potential/possibility of certain posts within the company’s staff establishment becoming redundant,” the company said.

The letter by the company’s regional head of Human Resources (HR) Hellen Akumu followed a meeting on January 16 by the business to assess its operations and said that there would be consultations to explore alternatives before the February 29 deadline.

The company, which operates across different countries, said it was finalising the plans this month and next.

“The business will set up consultative meetings within the months of January and February 2024. The ideas offered will be given due consideration as we finalise the plans. We shall after this period communicate the final position on the intended redundancy,” Ms Akumu said.

“Whilst exploring alternative avenues during consultations, we wish to notify you of the intended redundancy. If no alternative is found and the redundancy confirmed, as per existing laws, [it] will be effective from February 29, 2024,” the letter stated.

The Hamburg-headquartered NKG has more than 60 companies across the globe.

Kenya coffee is marketed either through the weekly Nairobi Coffee Exchange or sold directly to buyers abroad.

It is not clear the number of workers who will be affected by the looming layoff since the company has not made public details of its employees in Kenya.

Available details, however, show that the company, which has operations in 27 countries, employs 495 people in Africa. Across the 27 countries where it operates, the company employs more than 3,200 people.

In Kenya, the company operates through two subsidiaries, Ibero Kenya Limited, which deals in export and milling, and Tropical Farm Management Kenya, a marketing agent, financer and service provider to farmers.

The exit of the miller and exporter is also set to hit farmers and other workers not directly under its employ but have benefited from its operations across value chains.

President William Ruto in January 2023 signed an executive order tasking his deputy Rigathi Gachagua with spearheading reforms in the coffee and tea sub-sectors.

The campaign has proposed restructurings that include the introduction of a direct settlement system (DSS) aimed at realising expedited and transparent payment of coffee sales proceeds.

The drive is also seeking to push the enactment of the Coffee Bill 2023 that proposes to reorganise the industry by transitioning the regulatory and commercial roles currently undertaken by the Agriculture and Food Authority to the Coffee Board of Kenya.

Further, the legislative proposal also aims at transitioning coffee research currently undertaken by the Coffee Research Institute under the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation to the Coffee Research Institute.

These scheduled reforms have, however, triggered chaos in the sector amid delays in the issuance of marketing and milling permits. This has left millers and marketers without stocks for processing and sale.

Kenya’s coffee is much sought after by roasters and blenders and the international prices are used as a benchmark for the local price at the Nairobi exchange. The sector is, however, limping and requires a revamp as more farmers abandoned the crop for better rewarding ventures such as real estate and avocado farming.

The State is working to curb the slump amid concerns that the once thriving coffee sub-sector has lost its shine, with production declining from 130,000 tonnes to an average 40,000.

Multiple tax incentives and exemptions handed out to the ultra-wealthy and large investors in the past decade are undermining Kenya’s ambition to grow revenues, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said.

The IMF, in a new analysis of tax policy and administrative changes in the East African Community countries, says that Kenya’s tax-to-GDP ratio has been on a downward trajectory since peaking in 2014 after the country implemented policies that have ended up narrowing the tax base.

“We are the world. We are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day so let’s start giving”

On January 28, 1985, some of the biggest names in American music gathered at A&M Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles to record a song to support famine relief in Ethiopia. We Are The World became a global anthem using the power of music to turn the world’s attention to the hunger crisis in the Horn of Africa.

The story surrounding that historic recording is revealed in The Greatest Night In Pop, a documentary that premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19 and is available to stream on Netflix from January 29 2024. That date is significant because it marks exactly 39 years to the week the crème de la crème of American music gathered for a marathon recording session. As the 46 stars arrived at the studio straight from attending that night’s American Music Awards, they were greeted with a sign pinned by the record’s producer and conductor Quincy Jones, “please, check your ego at the door”.

Featuring never-before-seen footage, the film reveals the early planning stages of the recording done under United Support of Artists for Africa (USA for Africa), including the writing sessions of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie. Some of the artists who were at that historic session including Richie, Bruce Springsteen, Smokey Robinson, Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Loggins, Dionne Warwick and Huey Lewis, along with musicians, engineers and production crew reminisce about the events of that night.

Producer Julia Nottingham and director Bao Nguyen who worked together on the 2020 documentary Be Water about legendary martial artist Bruce Lee, reunite for this project that was conceptualised during the pandemic. “My parents were refugees from Vietnam and were music fans, though, and one of the lasting memories I had of childhood was listening to Kenny Rogers and Lionel Richie records,” recalls Bao who was no more than 4 years old when We are the World was released. “Those echoes of childhood came back when Julia mentioned the project to me.

Among the director’s first tasks was watching the 1985 documentary We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song hosted by actress Jane Fonda and from that he drew parallels with a heist storyline. “You have all these participants who each have their own superpower, they have this impossible task of assembling this iconic team and recording this song, and they have one night to do it.”

The new film takes a different approach to the earlier documentary by focusing on the run-up to the project, reframing the archive footage and giving the viewer a fly-on-the-wall peep into the scenes in the recording studio. The singers themselves admit their own anxieties, from the trembling knees of Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper concerned about her jewellery leaking into the microphone and Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan both nervous about their solos.

Lionel Richie who cannot conceal his emotions through most scenes in the film provides the crucial link to the events surrounding the making of the song. “He is one of the most impressive, humble, hardworking stars I have come across,” says Julia Nottingham.

“From an editorial perspective, he is diligent, he’s thorough. He’s just amazing. He challenged us in the best ways and always wanted the best for it. He brought his best self to every moment in it.”

Although some of the videotapes were in poor condition and others were lost, an unlikely source came to the rescue. Journalist David Breskin who wrote an article for Life magazine about the project had kept his Dictaphone recording from the moment he was assigned the story, a few weeks prior to the recording, including in the studio.

Some of that audio was painstakingly synced to footage that had lost its audio. “No one has ever heard Michael and Lionel write that song,” says Julia “In the world of making archive films, these are gifts that you pray for, and when they arrive, you just thank your lucky star.”

We are the World was officially released on March 7 1985, and in another milestone, over 8,000 radio stations around the world played the song simultaneously on April 5, 1995. The record sold more than 20 million copies and won three Grammy Awards in 1986, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year, and raised more than $60 million for charity.

“Considering the chaos that happened, considering the confusion that was there, on top of the egos, we are doing the video, we are doing the vocals, we are doing the background singers, we are doing the still shots for the cover of Life magazine, in 7 hours?” Quipped Lionel Richie during the premiere of The Greatest Night In Pop at the Sundance Film Festival last weekend. “It is impossible! It worked.”

Are some local banks over-risking in the Eurodollar market?,"Columnists Are some local banks over-risking in the Eurodollar market?

The magnitude of their exposure to dollar-denominated instruments is a real concern in the current environment. PHOTO | SHUTTERSTOCK

On Tuesday, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) quoted the shilling at 161.35 against the US dollar, a sharp drop from the 156.46 exchange rate at the end of December last year.

While some of the factors (both external and internal) behind this depreciation are well known, one gets a bad rap: the Eurodollar market - a misleading term referring to US dollars deposited in banks outside the United States and which are not subject to US banking regulations.

Are (some) players stockpiling dollars in anticipation that the local unit would lose further ground against the greenback and other major world currencies? I believe so.

The latest data from the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) shows foreign currency deposits increasing at a faster pace than before. Total deposits reached Sh1.2 trillion at the end of June 2023, up 32 percent from Sh 891.5 billion as of June 2022.

Specifically, corporate bodies accumulated slightly over Sh800 billion in absolute foreign currency deposits by mid-last year compared to Sh592 Billion in the year prior. Similarly, household foreign currency deposits climbed by 26 percent to stand at Sh373 billion as at the end of June 2023 compared to a year prior.

Now, we can assume that, since corporations account for about 70 percent of the dollar deposits, these holdings are purely for international trade reasons. While that may be true, it's highly probable some players see the market as a window to long the dollar as a way to hedge against the fast-depreciating shilling.

Furthermore, with Eurodollar deposits offering attractive rates over domestic deposit rates, the trade is a no-brainer - fueling this rate premium is the fact that the Eurodollar market operates with minimal regulatory constraints, which in theory, should allow for higher deposit rates.

That said, concerns are being raised over the expanding short-term forex maturities within the banking system. Rising Eurodollars deposits, sourced as term deposits maturing at near terms (weeks to several months), although deemed low risk, pose a huge risk with the key question being: in a prolonged dollar-shortage scenario, where will banks get dollars to fill the dollar-funding gap?

Typically, these gaps should be funded by interbank forex loans, borrowing from central banks, currency swaps, etc. However, all these markets are in a tight bind because of risk and liquidity concerns. So, in a doomsday scenario, if a particularly important bank or series of banks in the Eurodollar market were to default, this could trigger damaging bank runs.

Even if a bank is sufficiently capitalised, large Eurodollar obligations are likely to undermine liquidity. Given these risks, the rapid growth of the Eurodollar market should not go unnoticed.

Although it provides an alternate channel of financing for banks to load up their balance sheets with Eurodollar liabilities, the potentially dire consequences with respect to dollar funding gaps is a major concern and needs to be monitored.

The magnitude of their exposure to dollar-denominated instruments is a real concern in the current environment.

Jaboya: Radical wisdom emerges from the fish for sex trade,"Arts Jaboya: Radical wisdom emerges from the fish for sex trade

Millaz Players cast on stage at the Kenya National Theatre. PHOTO | POOL

Jaboya is Dhuluo, meaning “fish for sex” and it’s a form of gendered trade that is commonly used to describe what happens every day when the fisherman at Lake Victoria come back to land and find scores of women waiting to sell themselves for fish.

“It’s a function of poverty and lack of choices,” the BD Life is told by Kathy Tate-Bradish, an HIV educator who works in Western Kenya. “It’s the major factor resulting in the counties along the lake having the highest prevalence of HIV in Kenya,” she adds.

To best understand the meaning of Jaboya, one needed to be at Kenya National Theatre recently to watch Millaz Players’ performance of Jaboya. Scripted by Emmanuel Chindia, the play captured the vibrant, sensual energy that swells the shore every time men come in with their catch of the day. That’s when women scramble to be first in line since the transactions involve both money and fish for sex freely exchanged.

Read: Two contrasting views of town and country

We meet a stew of quibbling female fishmongers, all competing for access to the men with the most fish. For a Big Fish boss like Odongo (Sultan Mbimwa), he can have sex with no less than five women a night as we see while he argues with Otieno (Samuel Baraza) over the boat he’d promised him.

It’s the Chief (Gaitan Brian) who suggests to the women that they need to stop quibbling among themselves and organise to buy a boat of their own. His radical suggestion is antithetical to the traditional taboo related to women never becoming fisher(wo)men. Now we’re getting into thorny territory since the Chief's idea essentially calls on women to challenge patriarchal (man-made) taboos.

“There’s no reason women can’t be fishermen,” Chief says, sounding like a true feminist, not a government emissary spewing the conventional patriarchal party line. It takes some time for the women to hear what he’s saying and appreciate his radical wisdom. Eventually, they start believing that owning a boat of their own makes a lot of sense.

But then, they have another problem which is trusting one another and identifying one honest leader among them who they can all believe in. But once they do, they set up their own chama or economic merry-go-round to raise the cash required to buy the boat.

As it turns out, they can almost raise the funds required, but for Sh50. That money comes from Kamum (Faith Wambui), the young schoolgirl who won a cash prize for her high marks. But she understood the implications of the women being liberated financially. Yet by her making that sacrifice, she is left with insufficient funds for school fees. It's pathetic to see how she’s left stranded at home. Her only hope lies with the women buying the boat, something they are prepared to do as the story ends.

Unfortunately, women cannot end all the outmoded taboos in a single act of revolutionary courage. One that remains involves Beryl’s family which has a timeline on sex. All sex is outlawed within Her family’s timeframe of a 10-week period.

Tragically, Opiyo (Mike Ndaka) ignored that taboo and sleeps with Beryl (Mary Mutabe). And for that, he dies, illustrating just how deeply entrenched certain cultural beliefs still are in Luo and other African cultures generally.

No one except Odongo feels the pain at Opiyo’s demise since they’d been bosom buddies forever. The issue at hand is the programme of the women. They’d been basically sex workers as well as fishmongers before. But now they're on a quest to obtain their economic freedom since they would all own the boat and all share the spoils of fishing for their own food and their own fish business.

I hope Millaz takes Jaboya to Nyanza region and to the Lake where they could invite women to see the show since it could introduce them to a few revolutionary ideas that might have a positive impact on their lives.

Jaboya is an impressive production directed by Mike Ndeda, assisted by Faiz Ouma. The show’s choreographer did such a good job that the movements of the characters flowed naturally from the script’s action. The scriptwriter, Chindia did well to assemble so many important themes, keeping them flowing organically until he found a logical way for the women to rise above their oppressive circumstances and find a viable solution that could be a real possibility.

All power to the women! And to Millaz.

Kenya's healthcare presents a paradox. There is a steady exodus for specialised treatments abroad, at the same time there is an influx of patients seeking Kenya's specialised skills from the region.

A total of 569 patients were sent abroad for specialised care between 2021 and 2022, with India accounting for most of these referrals. In particular, 462 referrals or four out of every five patients, went to India, accounting for an outstanding 81.2 percent. Singapore, South Africa, and Israel are other markets where Kenyans sought specialised treatment.

The most common treatment sought abroad was open heart surgery (71 patients), followed by stem cell replacements (44) and bone marrow transplants (29). Other notable treatments were kidney transplants (11), liver transplants (21), radiotherapy (26), and arterial switch operations (20). Notably, 19 patients sought medical evaluation for wellness, diagnosis and alternative treatment options, and 17 travelled for chemotherapy.

The wide range of treatments sought highlights the equally diverse needs of people travelling abroad for medical care. Reasons advanced for India as a preferred destination for medical referrals include its perceived professional medical care at more affordable prices when compared to other markets.

While Kenyans seek advanced treatments overseas, Kenya paradoxically enjoys a strong reputation among its East African neighbours, attracting referrals from Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, Burundi, and Ethiopia. Additionally, its expertise draws patients from further afield, with referrals from Nigeria and even the Democratic Republic of Congo. According to the Ministry of Health, Kenya gets 3,000 to 5,000 medical tourists from other African countries.

Patients from these countries sought specialised treatment from both public and private hospitals. The Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH), for example, received 250 patients from neighbouring countries seeking specialised treatment. Many others were treated in various public and private health facilities.

This demonstrates that Kenya can position itself as a leading regional medical tourism destination in East Africa and beyond, attracting patients from around the world and stimulating growth across multiple sectors. In addition to helping the healthcare sector, the ensuing economic growth would empower communities, generate new employment opportunities, and advance Kenya's overall development.

The private sector will also play a key role in investing in advancing medical tourism in the country.

As we navigate through 2024, let us accelerate plans for a thriving medical tourism market in Kenya. If successful, a thriving medical tourism market would uplift lives and livelihoods.

Yony Waite: Activist artist who opened up space for indigenous Africans,"Visual Arts Yony Waite: Activist artist who opened up space for indigenous Africans

Yony Waite is one of the most important environmental and visual artists of Kenya, East Africa, and beyond the borders of the mind as well as geography. In fact, Yony ‘emerged’ as a citizen of the world long before she came to Kenya. Her passing on will touch the hearts of many who loved and admired her as an artist and activist for the planet.

She was born in Hollywood, raised on the island of Guam, and trained artistically both at the University of California, Berkeley, and Japan where she apprenticed under sagacious Master painters. By the time she arrived in Kenya after spending time in Somalia with family, she was already a practising professional artist. She initially came as a tourist. But then, I think she was grabbed by the land, the wildlife, and the ocean.

She was briefly married to David Hopcraft and lived on the family ranch at Athi River. Fortunately, a family settlement enabled her to stay at the ranch even after the couple split up. The ranch became a home base for her when she wasn’t staying in Lamu where she established her second home, an old four-story Swahili house, not far from the Lamu Museum.

Lamu is also where she set up her Wildebeeste Workshop, held exhibitions and ran trainings in print-making on her old printing press. She also designed projects with Lamu women groups. “I would work with her and the women when I went to see her,” Yony’s sister-in-law, Linda Benvenuto told the BD Life. “Together they’d produce wonderful wall hangings that Yony would sell and bring the revenue back to the women,” Linda explains.

But Yony would never remain in one place for long. She was always on the move, always a hippie at heart from the sixties. She, like so many of her generation, was inspired by Jack Kerouac’s novel, On the Road which was all about a band of buddies who traversed the US, celebrating their freedom with jazz, poetry, and ‘mind-expanding’ substances.

But to travel, Yony needed funds, not just to travel, but to open up spaces to exhibit her art. At the time, there were few galleries. So in 1969, she and the British artist, Robin Anderson and designer David Hart started Gallery Watatu.

“I never intended to run a business [at Watatu],” Yony said in words captured during her exhibition opening with Theresa Musoke and Tabitha wa Thuku at Circle Art Gallery several years back.

Linda Benvenuto, Yony's sister-in-law, next to Yony's 6ft tall four-panelled screen in Karen, Nairobi, on January 22, 2024. PHOTO | MARGARETTA WA GACHERU | NMG

She could have been talking about why she was happy to sell Watatu to Ruth Schaffner in 1985. The other two Watatu founders had left long before, and Yony didn’t want the responsibility, so she was happy to hand over her gallery as long as she could have a permanent foothold for her art at the space.

But years before she left Watatu to Ruth, Yony was advocating for indigenous Africans to exhibit at Watatu. The ones that did included everyone from Ancent Soi and Jak Katarikawe to Etale Sukuro and Theresa Musoke.

But apart from her roles as founder of two art galleries and artist producing paintings that project some of the most enchanting semi-abstract portraits of animals in the wild, Yony will be remembered for her passionate positions on war, peace, and the power brokers who benefit off of war at the expense of innocent civilians’ lives.

For instance, Yony felt so strongly about the American invasion of Iraq that she sacrificed her identity as an American citizen in protest against the Iraq war. She subsequently became a Kenyan citizen.

Up to the end, Yony refused to ‘die gracefully’. Instead, she was ‘on the road’, still afflicted with her third bout of pneumonia, and still insisting on flying to Lamu to tie up some loose ends. She then took buses to reach Mombasa, where she went to hospital but then got on a train back to Nairobi where she went straight to Nairobi Hospital. And when she was reminded that she had no will but had said she wanted to leave something to her workers, Linda says, “She wrote on the back page of the book she was rereading,” It turns out, the book was Kerouac’s On the Road!

Yony passed on January 13, 2024, a day we’ll commemorate from now on. Her spirit is immoral so, as much as we grieve her demise, we celebrate the beauty, light, wisdom, and joy she brought to us in her art and in her life.

A small collection of Yony’s paintings will be at One Off Gallery from January 27, 2024.

"Beyond COP28, it is open competition between oil demands and renewables","Columnists Beyond COP28, it is open competition between oil demands and renewables

Last year's COP28 climate forum was a fair arbitration between oil industry and competing renewable energy sectors. My understanding of the consensus is that the oil industry and renewables sectors will continue to invest within a managed energy transition, with government policies steering national and regional energy markets towards reduced carbon emissions and globally agreed climate targets while paying due attention to energy security.

Essentially, this opens up access to global funding for both oil and renewable energy sectors without recrimination, a situation that reduces activism in energy investments. And for energy economists, it will be a nightmare estimating future national and global oil demands which will additionally be impacted by the rate of renewable energy technology investments and uptake, besides the usual macroeconomics. Uncertainties or inaccuracies in global oil demand estimation can lead to oil price instability, with a negative influence on oil production investments.

Currently, the most imminent threat to oil demands across the world is the rate of electric vehicles (EVs) uptake. Unlike 10 years ago when EV technologies were nascent and experiencing doubts about their scalability, today EV unit costs continue to reduce, with mass uptake increasing especially in China, Europe, and the USA.

These countries are facilitating major production capacity expansion. At the current level of investments and research, EVs are expected to dominate the roads in 10 years.

In Kenya, we need to correctly estimate the pace of energy transition to allow the country to correctly plan its future petroleum and renewable infrastructure. Kenya, being mostly a second-hand vehicle market, will experience about a five-year lag relative to global EV uptake.

However, eventually internal combustion engine vehicles will give way to electric vehicles, a fact we need to consider when planning for petroleum and EV infrastructure.

Other areas of our energy markets that will be impacted by the energy transition are the potential replacement of fuel oil in thermal power generation and heavy industries, and the solarisation of diverse equipment that traditionally use petroleum products.

In respect of Turkana oil, we still have a window of about 15 years to monetise the oil resources to earn or save foreign exchange by exporting or reducing oil imports. How and when to include Turkana oil in Kenya’s economic and energy matrix is screaming for action. Countries around the world are having to contend with how to maximise the value from their oil resources before global oil demands diminish.

The government is seeking to build an additional 30 county aggregation and industrial parks for value addition to boost exports, even as it targets to double foreign direct investments to Sh1.6 billion this year.

Trade and Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Rebecca Miano said the establishment of the aggregation hubs would boost value-addition across value chains and spur manufacturing productivity.

The government had initially targeted 18 County Aggregation and Industrial Parks whose construction has begun. The addition means some 48 industrial parks will now be built under the programme.

“This growth strategy includes the establishment of 30 additional County Aggregation and Industrial Parks, stimulating the activation of priority value chains across the country,” Ms Miano said.

The CAIPs are special zones being set up in all 47 counties by FY 2025/26.

The facilities will provide value-addition centres for agricultural products as well as storage facilities.

The ministry targets to grow the contribution of Kenya’s manufacturing sector to the gross domestic product from 7.6 percent to 10 percent in 2024, with a long-term aim of 20 percent by 2030.

Ms Miano spoke during a meeting with heads of State corporations, agencies and departments within the ministry, where she laid down the strategic objectives for the current year and over the coming years.

“I would like to reiterate our ministry’s commitment to support the bottom-up economic transformation agenda and what we shall be presenting at the Cabinet retreat. Number one, we will be doubling exports to GDP from the current 10 percent, by 2027. Secondly is to double FDIs in 2024 from the current $800 million to $1.6 billion by the close of 2024,” she said.

Kenya Bureau of Standards managing director Esther Ngari said the agency continued to certify products small businesses produce, supporting their operations.

“Under operational efficiency. We achieved a remarkable 114 percent in certified products for micro, small and medium enterprises, helping them grow, and 59.2 percent increase of large firms which were certified reflecting successful operation efficiency enhancement,” she said.

At the same time, Industrialization Principal Secretary Juma Mukhwana said the ministry’s target was to wean as many agencies off exchequer support, by having them raise funds from operations.

“If you're buying raw materials and then you make a product and you sell it in the market, why do you want us to give you money?” the PS posed.

The High Court has endorsed a 2021 government policy centralising the procurement of leased motor vehicles by public bodies at the Treasury.

Dismissing a petition by Busia Senator Okiya Omtatah, High Court judge Lawrence Mugambi said the circular issued on June 26, 2021, was an amplification of what was already in law and policy (consortium procurement).

The judge said there was no need for public participation before the circular was issued by the Head of Public Service directing ministries, departments and agencies running leasing programmes to immediately register them with the Treasury to be managed centrally.

Also read: Omtatah sues to block MPs Sh4.4bn cover

“Central leasing is already incorporated in the Procurement and Asset Disposal Act 2015 and is described as consortium buying, a scheme where procurement entities can come together and procure jointly to benefit from economies of scale,” said the judge.

Justice Mugambi added that all that the circular did was to give guidance concerning that particular procurement item, but the rules did not change.

“It was not against the existing legal provisions nor was it usurpation of the roles of respective accounting officers. It did not contravene the existing statutory provisions. In my view, the circular was executive in nature and meant to guide the application of the prevailing policy,” the judge said, adding that the circular could thus not be considered a statutory instrument as argued by Mr Omtatah.

The senator had argued that policy centralising the leasing and procurement of leased motor vehicles by public bodies was invalid, as there was no public participation.

He added that the circular was made in bad faith and in contravention of the constitutional precepts of transparency, competitiveness and cost-effectiveness.

According to Mr Omtatah, the Head of Public Service has no capacity in law to unilaterally centralise the leasing programme.

It was his argument that the move would allow Treasury CS to usurp the responsibilities of specific procurement offices in the ministries, yet they have their own internal procurement systems.

The Attorney General defended the decision arguing that the government made the move to achieve value for money and that the allegation of usurping the role of accounting officers was unfounded and baseless.

The court heard that the argument by Mr Omtatah only aimed at trivializing the role of government in safeguarding public resources.

“The attainment of the objectives can only be realized if the government aggregates common user requirements that make economic sense for service providers and investors to deploy their resources that shall guarantee favourable returns on their investments,” the Attorney General submitted.

If you still receive the paper electricity bill, try tracking movements in the category ‘forex adjustment cost’ to appreciate the gravity of the suffering of the consumer as the Kenya shilling falls.

The depreciation of our currency hits the consumer in two ways. First, what is known in jargon as realised forex losses.

These are the losses that Kenya Power suffers when they have made foreign currency payments for actual foreign currency-denominated obligations such as power purchase costs, loans and interest on government-guaranteed foreign loans, and fuel from power plants using imported oil.

These costs are passed on to the consumer through the monthly forex adjustment costs using the Central Bank of Kenya's mean exchange rate.

Secondly, the unrealised forex losses. These are not recovered from the customer until the actual payments are made. They refer to book losses that Kenya Power suffers when it has to restate its loans and other liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in Kenya shillings, the reporting currency of its financial statements.

I hold the view that our future, in terms of both affordable prices and security of supply, will depend on the investments we make in locally produced power, including in coal and gas.

Where our energy sector is today, we cannot afford to be carried away by the climate change hysteria and postpone our plans for gas and coal.

Why is it that we no longer talk too loudly about the large coal deposits we discovered a long time ago in Kitui? Why do I get the impression that plans to import natural gas from Tanzania are on the back burner?

If you closely followed the politics of COP28, the subliminal message was that countries like China, Brazil and India are not prepared to sacrifice their economic health at the altar of the climate change cause.

This is how an Indian diplomat put it: ""We must have the right to dig coal just as the United States has a right to frack for gas"". He argued that Western countries that have taken their carbon space are leaving little space for countries from the developing world.

Expensive fuel

Thus, Kenya and Tanzania will not be out of place if they insist on pressing their right to produce natural gas and to convert some of the plants that use expensive imported fuel into using natural gas.

COP28 was happening against a backdrop of serious and urgent plans by Kenya to build a natural gas pipeline to run from Dar es Salaam to Mombasa.

This project will by far be the most significant game-changer in the efforts by the two countries to deliver cheap electricity to its citizens.

Already, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) had identified a suitable location for the building of both an LNG terminal and an LNG power plant in the Dongo Kundu, Mombasa.

Several years ago, Kenya — in anticipation of the proposed LNG pipeline from Dar es Salaam to Mombasa — came up with laws and regulations that oblige fuel power stations to convert from expensive fuel to cheaper natural gas as soon as the natural gas is available and is within reach.

The project will change the landscape and maths of power generation because, within the Mombasa region alone, Kenya has five power stations that will be obliged to do a fuel-for-natural gas swap when the Dar to Mombasa pipeline is completed.

Natural gas

The power plants which will have to implement fuel for natural swaps include Kipevu 1 with an installed capacity of 75MW, Kipevu 2 (74.5 MW) Kipevu GT (60MW), Rabai (90MW) and Kipevu 3 (120 MW).

The benefits from conversion to natural gas will be huge because based on current electricity prices, the estimates are that Kenya will experience an annual saving of Sh10 billion per year to electricity consumers.

With the public transport being the biggest cause of distributed air pollution, the conversion to gas will contribute to improved air quality.

The benefits to Tanzania will also be huge. The current estimates are that the country will earn $324 million in natural gas sales and a further $162 million in wheeling charges.

With the pipeline construction costs estimated at $700 million, the project constitutes one of the largest FDI inflows into Tanzania in recent years.

East Africa must resist the temptation of blindly joining the green lobby power by leaving their oil, gas, and coal in the ground in exchange of pledges for climate financing from the West.

My daughter wore a very small black dress for her birthday dinner. I have a history with it. I bought it when I travelled to New York. I was guided by a photo and specific instructions from her. Unable to find it in stores, I eventually found it on Amazon, which dropped it off at a drop-off point in Long Island where I was staying, and spent an hour at night looking for the drop-off point.

She looked devastating in it. She wanted to see the gardens at Talisman and as we made our way through the restaurant, men stared at her. I wanted to shout at them, “She is only 16!” The whole night, I sat there feeling a mix of feelings; pride and fear.

Proud that she was turning into a resourceful, respectable, and self-aware woman. Fearful that now she would meet all sorts of men, some terrible, and that she would hurt at times. Fearful that she would leave me in two years to chase her dreams and build her community as I grow old and arthritic and not be able to chew my food.

Our waiter was very kind to us and very attentive to her. Made her feel special. We both had the Chicken Al Limone and creamy mash, which was one of the best meals I’d had in a while. She ordered a mocktail to make her feel sophisticated and ladylike. My son, who barely talked to us because he insisted on bringing his goddamn tablet for dinner, had something fishy.

In the end, they brought out her cake from the kitchen under the hullabaloo of song and dance that she had warned me against. She turned and stared at me murderously and lovingly. I hate song and dance too but come on, it’s sweet 16! I wanted to make her 16th night memorable. I - egotistically, as a father should - wanted none of her boyfriends to match this night but also to give her a decent benchmark for them to do.

What a beautifully heartbreaking night at Talisman it was. Felt like we were all crossing the Rubicon.

Nairobi collects more revenue than 30 counties combined,"Economy Nairobi collects more revenue than 30 counties combined

Nairobi County continues to dominate its peers in revenue generation, collecting 22 percent of the own revenues reported by all the devolved government units in the last financial year.

Nairobi collected Sh8.16 billion compared to Sh36.8 billion generated by all 47 counties, according to a report by the National Treasury on financial statements in the 2022/23 fiscal year.

The report exposes disparities in own revenue collections with the 30 lowest performing counties contributing to only about a fifth (21 percent) of the total revenues.

This points to the concentration of economic opportunities in the capital and its surroundings, leaving much of the expansive country with little to contribute to the economy.

In 2021/22, Nairobi collected Sh7.6 billion, which was more than the combined collection of 32 counties that generated Sh7.5 billion.

In 2022/23, the 30 lowest performers collected between Sh46.8 million and Sh593.8 million.

They include Wajir (Sh46.8 million), Tana River (Sh59 million), Garissa (Sh82 million), Isiolo (Sh91 million), Nyamira (Sh97 million), Mandera (Sh123 million), Vihiga (Sh127 million), West Pokot (Sh128 million) and Marsabit (Sh142 million).

Embu (Sh593.8 million), Kirinyaga (Sh552 million), Nyandarua (Sh491 million), Homa Bay (Sh491 million), Kericho (Sh477 million) and Nandi (Sh199 million), are also listed among counties whose combined collection was surpassed by Nairobi.

Read: Only four counties meet own-source revenue target

Nandi, however, disputes its reported collection, saying the figure captured by the Treasury, and the Controller of Budget (COB) was not representative of all the own revenues during the year.

“Analysis of the report indicated this was actually underscored because some lines of revenues were not included. These include Sh171,354,269 being funds collected and spent under the Facility Improvement Fund Act, 2019. Similarly, another Sh12,047,051 was not reported. These, summed up, takes us to Sh381,701,320,” said Nandi County Executive Committee Member for Finance, Hillary Serem.

“We have since raised the same with the CoB who encouraged us to ensure self-reporting is always done accurately and timely,” he added.

Analysis of the own revenues performance shows that collections for 10 counties dropped, compared to their collections during the previous financial year.

Nakuru’s reported the highest drop of 50 percent to Sh1.6 billion, compared to the Sh3.3 billion it collected in 2021/22. Nakuru governor Susan Kihika did not respond to our questions on factors that could have affected the revenue performance, and strategies to boost the same in the current financial year and moving forward.

Nakuru was followed by Kisumu and Nyamira whose collections dropped by 42 percent each, to Sh695 million and Sh97 million respectively.

On the other hand, counties with the biggest improvement in own revenue collections were Narok, which more than doubled from Sh1.2 billion to Sh2.9 billion and Samburu, which increased from Sh112 million to Sh226 million.

Kiambu collected nearly Sh1 billion more, increasing from Sh2.7 billion in 2021/22 to Sh3.6 billion.

“We improved because we are running a government where commitment and integrity is a must. But even if there was an improvement throughout the period, this is hardly a number we can applaud given that it was during election season and there were transitional impacts,” said Kiambu governor, Kimani Wamatangi.

The governor, however, noted that even with the improvement, the county lost 30 percent of its own revenues to corruption activities within its workforce, noting that actual collections could have surpassed Sh5 billion. He said the outlook for the year ending June 2024 is for the county to collect Sh7.9 billion, which will be more than a third of its Sh22 billion budget.

Read: Nairobi own source revenue grows 17pc

With the Sh3.6 billion collections, Kiambu was the second after Nairobi, but it was still less than half what Nairobi recorded.

In total, seven counties collected more than Sh1 billion each from their own sources in 2022/23, down by one (Kisumu) from the performance in 2021/22.

Directline Assurance shocks PSVs with cashless fares,"Companies Directline Assurance shocks PSVs with cashless fares

All public service vehicles (PSVs) insured by Directline Assurance will have to switch to cashless fare platforms, including M-Pesa, as the insurer moves to curb fraudulent claims coming from passenger injuries and deaths.

Directline, which has the largest share of the PSVs insurance business, has issued a circular to all operators of matatus it has insured to make the shift effective February 1, in a move that also offers a revenue boost for banks and telcos that support cashless payments.

The insurer says it has developed a passenger manifest system for verifying third-party claims. The manifest will offer evidence that people making claims related to injuries or death were indeed in the vehicles involved in the accident.

Read: Directline doubles profit to Sh252m

“All public service vehicles to be insured by the company will be required to register with a cashless passenger manifest system. The company will provide the technology for the consolidation of the same. This will be put in operation through digital fare payment,” said Directline in a circular issued on Wednesday.

“To this effect, from February 1, 2024, the company will only issue policies to PSVs with a registered digital payment method from any of the payment gateways, for example, M-Pesa till available in the country.”

Direcline closed last June with Sh1.66 billion gross premiums from motor commercial PSV covers, giving it a 60.79 percent market share in this class of business, according to the Insurance Regulatory Authority data.

It was followed at a distance by Xplico (9.7 percent), Africa Merchant Assurance (9.26 percent), Invesco (9.01 percent), and GA Insurance (6.94 percent). Only 10 insurers in Kenya currently underwrite commercial buses and matatus.

Directline suffered Sh576.22 million underwriting losses in insuring matatus and buses in the six months ended June 2023, exceeding the Sh311.88 million loss in the full year ended December 2022.

The insurer’s move means passengers who make cash payments in buses and matatus may struggle to get compensation in case of an accident since Directline will only recognise those passengers captured in the digital manifest.

“The company requires PSV policyholders to implement a digital passenger manifest for verification of claimants after the occurrence of accidents.

This will enhance the process of injury claims management as well as adequately respond to the timelines being applied in the small claims court,” said Direcline.

An earlier cashless fare payment platform fronted by the government, launched in November 2014, flopped following opposition from matatu operators who felt that it was a ploy to monitor their daily earnings for taxation measures. The digital payment system required passengers to get pre-paid cards or use mobile money for payment of fares in PSVs.

Read: Directline takes 77 percent of matatu insurance

The motor insurance business has generally been a loss-making business for insurers over the years.

Many insurers have been aggressive in revising premiums upwards to reflect the level of risk in the market and also dropping comprehensive covers for some models of vehicles deemed too risky.

There have also been insurers adopting telematics—in-car monitoring devices— to adjust premium rates based on policyholders' mileage and driving habits.

Nivi Sharma: Leading in the shadow of greatness,"Profiles Nivi Sharma: Leading in the shadow of greatness

Before Nivi Sharma dives into what she does, she first makes this writer eggs with feta cheese and assorted condiments, throws in some spices in a pot, and roasts them before turning water into masala tea. She’s a great cook, but she isn’t as good as her husband, who, she insists, is an excellent cook, a biker, a camper, a man who faces all sunsets. But more of him later.

Now cupping a mug of coffee in her hands, Nivi talks about her tech journey as chief operating officer at BRCK, a tech startup that provided free public Wi-fi, and her innovation of KioKit, an award-winning digital education toolkit. In 2011, she co-founded eLimu, the first company to digitise the Kenyan Primary school curriculum content (later acquired by iHub in 2020).

Then her mother died, and as she scattered half of her ashes over the Ganges River at Rishikesh Bridge in Haridwar, India, she got answers that led her to take on the CEO role at Bridges to Prosperity, a global leader in rural infrastructure. The organisation has built 508 bridges in 21 countries, giving 1.8 million people access.

She serves on Standard Chartered Bank Kenya and The Open Institute boards. When she isn’t cooking or camping with her daughter, husband, and two sausage dogs called Bonanza and Jelly Bean, names she considered naming her daughter had her husband not put the kibosh on that. “Thank God, because he said, ‘No, Nivi, you name the dogs, I will name the child.’”

How did you end up building bridges in rural areas?

A property developer called Ken Frantz from Virginia, US, makes a big killing in a sale and, like a good American, buys himself a new Ford truck. As he sits in the waiting room at the Ford service station, he opens up a copy of a National Geographic magazine. He sees a photo of this broken bridge in Ethiopia, a very historical bridge. It’s called the Sebara Dildy, the Fasil bridge. It is a 17th-century bridge built over the Abbay River. Knowing what he knows about civil engineering and construction, he says, “I can go and build that bridge”.

And so he did and found his calling on that bridge. After that, he went around the world, from South America to Asia, looking for communities that showed a clear need to get from point A to point B and built a few bridges a year.

The turning point for Bridges to Prosperity was established by a young lady - Avery Bang - who came in as a university volunteer. This vision of solving a problem guided her; one in seven people in the world doesn’t always have access, and the amount of infrastructure dollars spent on rural infrastructure is shockingly low, especially given that 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas. Bridges are important in these areas because they help farmers make better decisions about the kind of crops to grow and farm inputs to buy - knowing that a bridge will always be there. This translates to a 75 percent increase in farmer profits and a 30 percent boost in their household income. I love to solve such problems, important problems that touch on humanity.

Was your childhood interesting?

It was a beautiful childhood. I’m grateful to my parents, who raised me to be grateful. They came here as immigrants with few [possessions], but they knew how to cultivate the networks to be entrepreneurs and business people and joy. They loved each other deeply. One of the greatest gifts they gave me, and if I may say, one of the most important things we can teach our children is how to make a happy life for themselves.

When we look around us, at our friendships and work, do we see what’s good about it? That’s the essence of cultivating joy. When dark times come, we should be able to recognise that as the shadow of greatness, right? That has guided me in my professional journey. I can say, yeah, of course, this person isn’t great at filling out spreadsheets and reports, but if I send him to a sales meeting or a meeting with a government official, he will leave with a different heart.

What are your earliest memories of your childhood?

Being sent home from school because my parents had not paid my school fees. My mom and dad fought about that because my dad gave away my school fees to help someone who lacked. [Chuckles]

What kind of a man was your dad?

Oh, let me tell you about my mom first. She came from a community of Indians called the Siddhis, known to be astute businesspeople and very good with numbers. They’ve amassed wealth in the Indian diaspora community. On the other hand, my father comes from the Bengalis, a community known for winning Oscars and Pulitzer prizes and writing novels. The Bengalis are very poetic. They compose beautiful songs and literature. Both of my parents refused to live their lives according to the community’s expectations.

Despite their differences, they made a beautiful couple. They loved each other profoundly and balanced each other well. My mom was always thinking about what came next, making plans. She was ambitious. My father always had a joke, a smile, and kindness to share with anyone around him. He was terrible with money. (Chuckles). My dad still walks with a bunch of Sh50 notes that he gives to anyone he thinks the money might bring a smile to their face.

Sometimes, I look at him and think he is just a man looking for external validation. Other times, I see the genuine joy he gets from making other people happy, however big or small that may be. That’s quite an infectious and, sometimes, irritating thing to be around.

Quite the couple, your parents.

Yes. It was my mom’s fourth anniversary on Tuesday. I was raised in the shadow of a great woman. She was brilliant. Being human, she made some horrible mistakes, as we all do in our lives, but she told me to always be present in moments. Like everyone, I’ve been embarrassed by my parents. I have laughed at my parents. I would not always get presents on my birthdays, but she would write me a card filled with blessings, good wishes, love, and aspirations.

She’d list things like how she’s inspired by me and what she sees in me. Being a young woman going into the world, being deeply loved by my mother, my role model, and just being told that I am amazing, that I’ve got greatness in me, that the world is lucky to have me, was so validating. [In reverie]. She would write these cards, run out of space, and write on the back of the cards. She would write poetry for me and my dad. My dad once wrote, “You’re twelve years old now; maybe you can stop being so stupid” on the birthday card she had written for me. [Laughs hard] I still laugh at it to this day. I have kept all those cards. Oh, my dad is such a silly man.

Your mom’s death must have been like a bomb going off in your home.

Devastating. We’re just a nuclear family in Kenya. It’s always been just my brother, myself, and my parents. My mom was the one who would make plans and figure out where we would live and how we would pay bills. She was the breadwinner.

On a recent trip, I realised I’d have to buy flights and book hotels for my father. You know, because he cannot do that.[Chuckles] She was the grown-up. She was the one who would insist on when we would get together whenever there was something important to talk about, what the family needed to do, think about, and pray about. She was a voracious reader and spiritual in a very intellectual sense.

My father’s very ritualistic. He’ll go to the temple, ring the bell, and pour milk daily. My mom would tell us about Jesus and the Sikh gods and say, “Well, why do we light a fire and hold it throughout the house? Why do we light incense sticks? And why do we ring bells?”

How has your dad survived without her?

I think 2020 was a challenging year for a lot of elderly people. For a widower, it was very tough. I think about my mom often, but he thinks about her constantly. He talks about things she would say or approve of or what would irritate her. He kisses her photos, tiny little kisses. [Pensive pause] He loves her deeply. [Pause] For a while, I resented that love as I had boyfriends who would constantly disappoint me. [Chuckles]

What kind of teenager were you?

I was such a terrible teenager. I apologised to my mother all her life for being so bad. I was angry a lot of the time for reasons I felt were good. No one knew why I was rebellious. I would often lie to my parents, sneak out, be in places where I shouldn’t be, try smoking, and have the worst boyfriends.

I put them [parents] through it. When I was getting married, my best friend said, “It’s a good thing you don’t need a hen night, because that’s what your whole life has been”. [Laughs hysterically]. But I really worried my parents. They had a lot of sleepless nights, wondering when I would be home.

What have been some of the notable headwinds of your life?

The death of my mom. Again, like coming back to coins, every coin has a different side to it, right? Her death was devastating, but out of that, I found genuine kindness from strangers and volunteers who came to the morgue and helped me wash her body and dress her up. Did you know that’s a thing people volunteer for? Her death showed me the kindness in humanity.

Nivi Sharma is the CEO at Bridges to Prosperity. PHOTO | POOL

If you were to apologise to one person, who would that be?

[Long pause] It would be some friends I’ve lost along the way. I’m turning 40 soon and through my 30s, I’ve deepened how I think about and navigate friendships. I don’t have many friends, maybe one or two friends I could call in the middle of the night to bury a body.

I’ve walked away from a lot of friendships without having important conversations. Maybe I’ve hurt those people. I also think of past romantic relationships as well. I’ve been flippant in ending relationships that didn’t align with mine. I don’t know if that’s a function of being an Aquarius, being able to move on. But I think I’ve hurt a lot of people. I would apologise to these people.

Do you feel a shift as you approach 40?

I think 40 is a powerful time in a woman’s life. There’s so much written about menopause, which I’m not at yet there, but as women, one of the interesting side effects of menopause that is not spoken about enough is your oestrogen makes you nice to people, and so as women hit menopause, their nonsense detector gets really honed in. When you see more women leaving their husbands and filing for divorce, it really is a function of not having enough oestrogen. [Chuckles] So, I think the shift I’m seeing is being more selective with who I allow into my space and more gracious and understanding.

Your parents set a benchmark for relationships. Were you looking for your father in the man to marry?

Two young fish swimming through the water meet an older fish who says, ‘Good morning, how’s the water?’ The two fish swim on, and one turns and asks the other, ‘What water?’ That’s a good way of explaining how your parents’ relationship shapes what you think relationships should be, whether abusive or loving.

I didn’t see many other couples growing up because we didn’t have a huge social circle or a big family. I always said, ‘I’m going to marry a man who’s got a big career, and the financial burden should not fall on me to be the sole breadwinner.’

Looking at my dad’s flaws - forgetfulness, etc - I was going to marry an organised man, but on the other side of the coin, a man beautiful in personality, a generous human man like my dad. But then it all changed, and at some point, I was sure the non-negotiables were not about money or ambition.

I never heard my father raise his voice, let alone his hand, or swear at my mother. And I can’t imagine my husband or a partner doing that. And maybe that’s why I’ve had so many failed relationships: You raised a voice, and I was a foot out. My husband is a beautiful, kind, and loving man who has never changed his true nature, so yes, I married my father. [Laughs]

How did you two meet?

During the Constitution referendum. I had organised an election observation, and he was one of the volunteers. A few years later, I was having a Kenya Jubilee housewarming party, and I invited him. The dress code theme was gold, so he came carrying a Tullamore Dew whisky. He hung out in the kitchen (he loves to cook) where on the blackboard wall, which featured a chapati-maker at the top, he drew graffiti around it and wrote the words ‘Jackpot!” [Laughs]

After a week or two of dating, we both knew we had found ‘the one’. He took me on his motorbike, a Honda, to a tea plantation in Limuru, where he proposed. It’s the same motorbike we rode on our wedding day. Even eight years after our wedding, I still feel he is ‘the one’. We still acknowledge to each other how lucky we are to have this kind of love. He’s a very kind and loving soul, a brilliant cook, and a beautiful father to our daughter. I’m lucky.

Penalties for illegal State actions breach Sh126bn,"Economy Penalties for illegal State actions breach Sh126bn

Attorney General Justin Muturi. FILE PHOTO | DENNIS ONSONGO | NMG

By CONSTANT MUNDA

Penalties and fines arising from contract breaches, unlawful dismissals, human rights violations and other legal disputes committed by government officials increased nearly Sh18 billion in William Ruto’s first year in office, further burdening taxpayers.

Historical court awards against State ministries, departments and agencies climbed to an estimated Sh126.20 billion last financial year ended June 2023, analysis of sector budget reports indicate.

The value represents a jump of 16.50 percent over an estimated Sh108.32 billion the year before, signalling the growing cost of unlawful decisions made by public officers. Some of the awards represent cases determined three decades ago.

The bills, disclosed through sector expenditure proposals presented to the Treasury ahead of budgetary allocation for the financial year starting July, present a major strain on the country’s already fragile financial position. The reports show the government has paid Sh11.39 billion of the awards, representing 9.03 percent of the outstanding arrears.

The penalties against illegal actions by the State continue to mount despite Attorney-General Justin Muturi's warning last year that accounting officers may in future be sanctioned for breaching agreements with contractors and employees.

Accounting officers in public sectors are largely principal secretaries in ministries and chief executives of parastatals.

The unlawful decisions by officers have become a major liability to the Exchequer, with the awards now a key driver of pending bills for the national and county governments.

The Budget and Appropriation Committee of the National Assembly in 2021, for instance, estimated potential compensation for ongoing litigation in local and international courts at about Sh1.2 trillion from Sh809 billion in 2019.

“Greater vigilance is required to control the escalation. I am addressing the issue using various strategies which I am not at liberty to discuss,” Mr Muturi told the Business Daily in January 2023, adding that the awards were in excess of Sh150 billion at the time.

“Going forward I may be forced to recommend that State officers who are shown to be reckless in decision-making assume personal liability in certain instances. I believe that the government as a whole is obligated to protect public resources while contracting third parties, be they local or international.”

Reached for comment on the latest development, the government’s chief legal adviser referred this publication to Charles Mutinda, head of the General Civil Law and Claims Section at the State Law Office.

Mr Mutinda said growth in court awards against government ministries and departments—where the AG’s office is directly involved—are on a downward trend.

He hinted the higher value than a year earlier, as presented in the sector budget proposals, could include decisions against semi-autonomous State-owned enterprises, which are governed by independent boards.

Records at the AG’s office show that historical decisions against the government, which involve monetary awards amounted to Sh93.3 billion last October, the top legal counsel said, without providing the numbers for the previous year.

“We only deal with mainstream government, that is, ministries and departments,” Mr Mutinda told the Business Daily.

“However, we have a few State corporations that request our assistance and where there are awards against them, we capture the same.”

The data from the AG’s office shows that the Sh93.3 billion was awarded in 510 historical cases where the court decisions went against the State.

However, two cases account for more than 90 percent of the claims.

These are Sh53.6 billion awarded to Equip Agencies against the Ministry of Health and Sh33.35 billion to Nguruman Ltd against the Attorney-General over the invasion of more than 200 acres of land in Kajiado, according to Mr Mutinda.

The award to Equip Agencies has rocketed from Sh1.86 billion in 1999 when it was first given.

The State has appealed both determinations. For instance, the hearing of the appeal against Equip Agencies is set for January 30, this year.

“We have enhanced advisory, especially on contract implementation to avert claims and we also continue to strengthen the [AG’s] office through additional human resource capacity, funding and decentralization,” Mr Mutinda said.

“The corporations, on the other hand, are required to inform the AG of any major litigation they are facing for information and guidance.”

The analysis of the reports presented to the Treasury shows the Health sector has the largest share of court awards (Sh40.95 billion—a figure which smaller than that provided by the AG’s office), followed Energy, Infrastructure and ICT sector (Sh36.81 billion), while Agriculture’s claims were estimated at Sh26 billion.

The concern over mounting claims and the need for accounting officers to take “personal responsibility” to ease the rising burden on taxpayers started taking shape during the reign of predecessor AG Paul Kihara back in 2020.

Also read: Judiciary revenues up 10pc to Sh2.6bn as fines, fees rise

“The tendency with government officials to have a ‘Laissez-faire’ attitude in making unlawful decisions should be strongly discouraged and such officers penalised accordingly,” Mr Kihara wrote in a publication by the State Law Office in 2020.

“This reduces the mentality amongst government officials that an offence so committed it is the government, which is the defendant and not the officer as a person.”

Kenya in 2020 engaged about 700 lawyers from the State Law Office to battle a huge backlog of cases in local and international courts.

Tullow Oil plans to retain its annual spending on Kenya’s oil project at Sh1.6 billion ($10 million), pointing to a sustained interest in the project that has dragged on for years since the discovery was made in 2012.

The British oil explorer in the latest trading update said it plans to trim its overall capital spending across countries it has a presence in from $380 million (Sh61.95 billion) to $250 million (Sh40.76 billion) as it takes a drilling break in Ghana.

Kenya’s budget for this year is the same as that spent last year and will be equal to four percent of Tullow’s planned overall capital spending.

Tullow will in March formally issue the full-year trading results, in which it is expected to give further details on the progress of Kenya’s oil project. The project has suffered several setbacks, delaying key decisions.

TotalEnergies and Africa Oil Corp, who held a 25 percent stake each in project oil Kenya, pulled out in May last year, over what was explained as “differing internal strategic reasons,” leaving the London-listed firm alone in the oilfields.

The withdrawal of the two firms left Tullow as the sole partner in the project, a development it said created a more flexible proposition for a strategic partnership. Tullow said it was continuing with discussions with several interested parties.

There has also been a delay in getting approval on its final field development plan (FDP)—a document that outlines how Tullow intends to develop the oil fields, forecasts for production and costs, as well as how it plans to manage the impact of the project on the environment and society

Tullow had together with TotalEnergies and Africa Oil Corp, in March last year, submitted the plan for approval to the Energy Ministry and the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority, before the two partners pulled out.

The plan was based on a life of field resource of 585 million barrels gross, initial plateau production of 120,000 barrels of oil per day, and capital investment of $3.4 billion (Sh554.3 billion) for the first oil.

Tullow was expecting the approval process, including ratification by Parliament, to conclude last year but this did not happen, even as its two partners pulled out.

The firm said the exit of two partners led to a re-assessment of risks associated with reaching a final investment decision, resulting in a $9 million (Sh1.47 billion) impairment.

CMA to expand over the counter bond trading,"Capital Markets CMA to expand over the counter bond trading

The Capital Markets Authority is overseeing the expansion of over-the-counter bond trading in the secondary market as part of measures to establish a reliable yield curve by reducing inefficiencies.

According to the capital markets regulator, the initiative will include easing licensing for securities dealers who primarily engage in the over-the-counter (OTC) bond market where buyers and sellers engage directly including negotiating prices.

OTC bond deals have been stifled by elaborate licensing of players that has resulted in just four entities getting the nod.

They are Standard Chartered Bank, SBM, Kingdom Securities and investment advisory firm Private Wealth Management.

“The process of licensing can be very involving and so, we are making it easier so that they can take up that licence,” CMA chief executive officer Wycliffe Shamiah said on Thursday.

Without adequate dealers, off-market bond deals have been forced to be cleared through intermediaries in the organised Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE).

Read: CMA tightens rules to check directors and stockbrokers

At present, only the EABX Group Plc, a company that proposes to establish and operate an over-the-counter exchange in East Africa, has applied to be an authorised securities dealer.

“If you have huge players like banks who want to transact among themselves, they may negotiate the transaction and price the deals but the rules dictate that they go through members of the exchange to complete the transaction. This has brought a bit of inefficiencies,” added Mr Shamiah.

Further to increasing the number of authorised securities dealers, the CMA says it is working with the NSE to improve the exchange’s own Unquoted Securities Platform (USP) that has a window for off-market bond trades.

The revamp is expected to include the creation of new rules and a system that will allow players to provide two-way quotes on securities during pre and post-trade sessions.

“We have asked the NSE to come up with specific OTC rules for bonds,” added CMA director of policy and market development Luke Ombara.

Currently, the USP's listings are Acorn investment/development real estate investment trusts, the Linzi Sukuk and Laptrust’s real estate investment trust while the market has been described as fairly illiquid.

The National Treasury is eager for the reforms to widen off-market bond trading as it seeks to deepen the domestic securities market.

Automated exchange

“We will further enhance the market infrastructure through policy support to market participants to operationalise an over-the-counter automated exchange to complement the broker-intermediate NSE,"" the Treasury told IMF.

""The aim of the exchange will be to promote trading transparency and settlement efficiency and attract more capital in the economy, eventually leading to reduction of yields and cost of new public debt issues.""

Bond trading in the secondary market has come under sharp focus in the past year as rising interest rates in the primary auctions distort pricing in the secondary market.

New Sh70bn bond tests resolve to cut domestic debt,"Capital Markets New Sh70bn bond tests resolve to cut domestic debt

The government is seeking Sh70 billion in an infrastructure bond (IFB) sale that will test the resolve of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to keep the cost of domestic borrowing in check.

The eight-and-a-half-year infrastructure bond, which is the second of its type being sold in the current fiscal year, has been floated in a period of heavy maturities of government debt, underperforming revenue collection and external borrowing, raising the pressure on CBK to take up expensive bids in bond sales.

The bond will be on sale until February 14, having hit the market on Wednesday.

In February, domestic debt service obligations—maturities plus coupon payments—are estimated at Sh280.9 billion, nearly half of which lies on maturities of the 91-day Treasury bill.

The Treasury’s latest statement of revenue and expenditure (for December 2023) showed that the tax revenue for the first six months of the fiscal year stood at Sh1.05 trillion, equivalent to 42 percent of the full-year target of Sh2.49 trillion.

Read: CBK faces upward rates pressure in January bond sales

Analysts have also pointed to the tougher stance taken by investors in the January bond sale as an indicator that investors will continue demanding a premium for lending to the government.

In the January bond that sought Sh35 billion, the CBK was forced to leave Sh12 billion on the table from bids of Sh37.2 billion in the initial sale after some investors asked for more than 19 percent in interest.

In the subsequent Sh15 billion tap sale meant to mop up the rejected bids, investors offered Sh11.8 billion.

“The trend, at a time when the fiscal agent is behind its domestic borrowing schedule, could force the CBK to continue accepting aggressive investor bids which portend higher pressure on domestic interest rates in the near/medium-term,” said analysts at NCBA Capital.

The tax-free infrastructure bonds—which are not benchmark bonds— have, however, tended to be an outlier in terms of interest rates compared to normal fixed-term bonds.

The 6.5-year November IFB for instance paid investors an average return of 17.93 percent. An ordinary bond of a similar tenor, which carries a tax obligation of 10 percent on interest would need to pay 19.92 percent to give an investor a net return that is equivalent to that of the IFB.

This attractive tax-free return has made infrastructure bonds popular with both local and foreign investors, with the latter usually taking less interest in ordinary bonds.

The November IFB, which sought Sh50 billion on the initial sale, raised bids worth Sh88.9 billion out of which the CBK took up Sh67.1 billion.

Despite the oversubscription and acceptance of a higher-than-targeted amount, the Treasury rolled out a tap sale on the offer that sought Sh25 billion but ended up raking in Sh47.8 billion from investors after yet another oversubscription.

This bodes well for the Treasury’s efforts to raise a substantial share of its Sh471.4 billion net domestic borrowing target for the current fiscal year from the February IFB.

Joshua Oigara has completed one year as the CEO of Stanbic Bank Kenya and South Sudan, leading the Kenyan business in posting a nine-month net profit that was more than what was recorded in the full year ended December 2022.

Mr Oigara spoke to the Business Daily about his journey at Stanbic, what worked for the bank in 2023, his view on 2024 and how the bank is responding to challenges such as elevated interest rates and increased defaults.

You have closed over a year at Stanbic since moving from KCB Group. How has the journey been like?

It has been quite exciting. The possibilities for Stanbic Bank and Standard Bank [parent company of Stanbic] on the continent are immense. If you look at the opportunities of transforming lives, bringing in new clients and connecting dots across the continent, I wouldn’t have joined Stanbic at a better time.

The more I reflect on the challenges of the continent, the more I realise Stanbic has a chance to play in moving the continent forward.

Your 2023 nine-month results reflected a 34 percent rise in profits, racing past the full year for 2022. What worked for you in a year earnings for many of Stanbic peers were slowing down?

What I loved most in the nine months was the strong growth in client activities such as trade and investment. Our performance was as a result of strong fundamentals and managing our risk much more clearly even as the cost of funds increased.

Where we saw weaknesses is the area of increased interest rates. But we took a lot of opportunities to support our clients early enough. We started preparing in March 2023 on how to support clients facing less disposable income and higher taxes

A lot of people spoke about the challenging macroeconomic environment, high inflation, high-interest rates and depreciation of the Kenyan shilling against foreign currencies. But I would say, generally in the business cycle, there are headwinds.

The cycles are part of the nuances of the economy. Our challenge is to be prepared from a risk model to take advantage of such cycles.

By preparing early enough, we were able to ride the wave we faced. I don’t think we are there yet. This may take another year or two to resolve.

What are some of the support measures you are taking to support clients who are running into difficulties of servicing loans?

Additional facilities for individuals, additional working capital facilities for our enterprise clients, SMEs and large clients and being able to accommodate those who need extended periods to service their loans. We have refinanced through top-up facilities for those who need to settle old loans.

We have also accommodated price increases. We haven’t passed the full cost increase to clients. If you look at the rising central bank rate (CBR), the bank has had to accommodate customers by absorbing part of the cost of funds.

Despite the support to customers, Stanbic had by the third quarter of 2023 increased provisioning for loan defaults. What was the thinking behind this and what’s your view in the New Year?

Risk management in a difficult environment is one of the greatest strengths an institution should have. We see the headwinds. Our clients are facing pressure. Their income levels are coming under a lot of attack from different areas.

If you are an SME moving goods from one area to another, your transport costs have gone up, power costs have increased and yet you are not really pricing up your goods. We have also had sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing where we have faced difficulties with some of our clients.

High-interest rates mean there is a likelihood of more defaults. We anticipate clients will face such difficulties and so when we do forward modelling, we realise we need to increase our level of provisioning.

It is probably the highest provisioning we have held as a bank in the last three or four years but we expect this to ease in 2024 or 2025. My view is that this environment we are in is not short-term.

After three upward CBR reviews in 2023, what is your take on the direction of interest rates going forward?

Do we anticipate interest rates to come down? I think we do in the medium term. I can’t tell you if it’s happening in 2024 or 2025 but I think once inflation is down then we should begin to see this easing.

Central Bank of Kenya closed 2023 with a CBR rise that took the figure to levels seen 11 years ago. This is a new pressure point for borrowers. How do you see this playing out?

This is not a new chapter. When you create new limits, you create new possibilities for clients. Rising interest rates will bring in more pressure for clients but the clients and banks are very dynamic.

As a bank, we haven’t been able to pass the full cost of the increase in funds to clients given the CBR review. I don’t think this will happen even with the new rate.

We will continue to support our clients by engaging them to know what we can offer in line with their cash flow positions. The underlying business position of our clients has not changed. What has changed is their cost profile.

Large clients are prepared to remodel their finances while private customers have flexibility within themselves to balance price increases. We are seeing more pressure on mass market clients like SMEs.

I think we will come out much stronger as an industry by working closer with our clients. We just need to be more cautious and proactive in supporting our clients.

Interest rates are going up, the shilling is weakening against the dollar and job stability is threatened. Are we at that point where banks have to activate the strategies that worked during Covid-19 pandemic?

There are many shocks in the financial sector than we always imagine, only that we remember big bang like Covid-19 and the financial crisis, Russia-Ukraine war and now the Israel-Hamas situation.

The situation we are in has progressed gradually unlike the Covid-19 shock. The adjustment we needed to make is what you have seen the CBK do and we are very much aligned to it.

We have known how to support our clients through a crisis and so I don’t think the current crisis is to the magnitude of Covid-19. Having said that, the value of non-performing loans in the industry are currently at their highest levels ever and the way to get out of it is to stay closer to our clients.

Our clients’ level of imagination and their energy towards their businesses is what defines why we exist. So, staying close to them and making sure we walk with them through the crisis is key. That is what we are doing at Stanbic and we are projecting our NPLs ratio will come down in 2024 because we are able to work with clients through this cycle.

Looking at South Sudan and the businesses that operate their, including Stanbic, is it almost just a case of keeping the lights on? What are the prospects?

To the contrary, we see relative stability in South Sudan than before. You can only get to feel the pulse of South Sudan when you visit Juba or Rumbek or go to Yei.

The amount of investment going on in sectors such as infrastructure, housing, education and healthcare is different from what people see today. The macroeconomic challenges and the level of currency depreciation is much less. We anticipate South Sudan to come out of hyperinflation by the end of 2024.

I am quite excited. Are we building our business? Yes. We opened up new sites of representation in 2022 and we intend to do much more. We are there for the long haul. The energy sector is a big part of our growth momentum and this is expected to continue growing.

We see international development organisations like United Nations and World Food Programme running and we are seeing huge investments in telecommunication coming up. We see bubbling economic activities than before.

Unfortunately, many Kenyan businesses are not represented in South Sudan. For me, it is a pity. It is a great opportunity just like the DRC Congo especially when you look at the volume of goods entering South Sudan.

There always questions about whether the country’s laws and regulations are moving fast enough. I think the answer is that it can get better.

One of the sticky problems is that of pending bills for people and businesses that do business with government. How do you see this playing out?

There are cases where clients are unable to get their payments but government ultimately settles the obligations. Pending bills is an old problem and I have no doubt it is going to be there in 2024. So it is the bridge-financing and working close with clients, especially the SMEs, to give them the support and accommodation they need.

KMRC weighs market for second bond issuance,"Markets & Finance KMRC weighs market for second bond issuance

The Kenya Mortgage Refinance Company (KMRC) is planning to return to the bond market to issue the second tranche of its Sh10.5 billion medium-term note to raise more funds for the disbursement of cheaper housing loans.

In a progress assessment report, the African Development Bank (AfDB), which has invested Sh15.8 billion in the company, said the mortgage financier is evaluating the market conditions to see if they will allow the issuance of their second bond this or next year.

Read: KMRC grows cheap home loans four-fold to Sh6.8bn

“During 2023, the macroeconomic condition has been challenging for bond issuance in part due to high interest rate, and inflation environment,” the bank said.

“Hence, KMRC has not been able to issue a follow-up tranche under the MTN program and continues to monitor the market conditions for possible bond issuance in 2024-2025.”

KMRC in February 2022 raised more than Sh1.4 billion from its first bond issuance as part of the Sh10.5 billion MTN that was to be raised from the domestic market within four years.

The initial bond diversifies the institution’s funding sources, ending its reliance on foreign development financial institutions and concessional lenders, which had been the primary source of funding for its refinancing activities since its establishment in 2018.

The money raised from the bond and other concessional lenders, including the World Bank, has so far enabled KMRC to refinance 3,142 mortgages valued at Sh9.6 billion as of September last year, AfDB said.

It is working with 12 primary mortgage lenders, which are also shareholders, allowing people to access mortgages at a rate of about 9.5 percent, less than the country’s average mortgage rate of 12.3 percent.

However, if the difficult conditions, characterised by high inflation and interest rates, persist, KMRC may not be able to issue the second bond this year or in 2025, impacting their ability to continue issuing affordable housing loans in the country, AfDB warned.

Kenya’s commercial property market remains in the doldrums, with the value of non-residential buildings approved in the 11 months ended November 2023 by Nairobi County falling below the pre-pandemic levels.

The latest data published by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows that the value of non-residential buildings stood at Sh31.5 billion in the review period.

This was less than half of the Sh71.5 billion recorded in a similar period in 2019. The value of the approvals fell to Sh44.8 billion in the same period in 2020 and declined further to Sh26.5 billion before rising to Sh32.2 billion in 2021.

A few office developments were expected to be completed last year largely due to the historic oversupply, with investors wary of putting money in this class, said Knight Frank, a property consultancy, in a report for the first half of 2023.

Read: Nairobi suburbs post fastest land price surge in four years

“Additionally, the increasing cost of capital amidst struggle by developers to service their loans has made financial institutions very conservative in supporting large real estate developments, hence the subdued real estate activities,” said Knight Frank.

However, the market for residential buildings seems to be on a recovery path with KNBS showing that homes approved for construction in Nairobi in the review period rose to Sh163.6 billion. This is more than the Sh128.2 billion approved in 2019 and which was the previous peak.

Commercial property market, which had been roiled by oversupply before Covid-19 has been hit with a tough economic environment that has seen small businesses go for smaller spaces even as some companies adopt remote and co-working to cut costs.

“Even before the pandemic in 2019, there was already an oversupply of commercial and retail in this market,” said Johnson Denge, a real estate investment analyst.

“That accumulated with the issue of the pandemic which elevated the growth of e-commerce or online shopping and the market adopted what you call a kadogo economy (low-end consumer business),” said Mr Ndenge.

Mr Ndenge explained that small businesses were grappling with high operating costs and high taxes, pushing them to smaller spaces.

Moreover, with attractive returns from the risk-free government securities, a lot of investors have opted out of the riskier asset classes such as real estate.

Even as fewer commercial properties, which also include the retail market, a lot of non-residential buildings remained unoccupied even as prime office rents remained static at $1.2 per square foot per month in the first half of last year, according to Knight Frank.

Some of the major completions include Principal Place, Karen Green, PTA Complex, The Rock, The Piano, and The Cube.

The pick-up in the residential market is driven partly by the affordable housing approvals, said Mr Denge.

UK walks away from post-Brexit Canada trade talks ‘over hormones in beef’ – business live,"02.55 EST UK-Canada trade talks break down in beef over cheese

The UK has walked away from post-Brexit trade talks with Canada in what one expert described as a “blow to the government’s trade story”.

Canada said the breakdown in talks came because the UK insisted on maintaining restrictions on its agricultural products, of which beef treated with hormones has been a persistent problem. The BBC on Friday reported that the beef dispute was a key factor in the failure of talks.

British cars will also face tariffs from the end of April when imported to Canada. Canada had already imposed a 245% tariff at the start of the year on British cheeses such as stilton and cheddar if they fell outside the already existing quota for non-EU imports.

In a statement posted on X, a British government spokesperson said “we reserve the right to pause negotiations with any country if progress is not being made”.

A spokesperson for Canadian trade minister Mary Ng said:

We are disappointed that negotiations with the UK are being paused. Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations.

Ng’s UK counterpart, Kemi Badenoch, did not appear to have commented on the breakdown in talks by Friday morning. Badenoch has been seen as a contender for the Conservative party leadership if Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is pushed aside, in part because of her work on trade deals.

David Henig, UK director for the European Centre For International Political Economy, a trade-focused thinktank, said it was “little surprise” that the UK had failed to reach a deal with “persistently tough negotiating partners”. He added it was “a blow to the government’s trade story.”

Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens ‘wrongly fined for driving in London Ulez’,"Hundreds of thousands of EU citizens were wrongly fined for driving in London’s Ulez clean air zone, according to European governments, in what has been described as “possibly one of the largest data breaches in EU history”.

The Guardian can reveal Transport for London (TfL) has been accused by five EU countries of illegally obtaining the names and addresses of their citizens in order to issue the fines, with more than 320,000 penalties, some totalling thousands of euros, sent out since 2021.

The Liberal Democrats’ transport spokesperson in the London assembly has called for an immediate investigation, saying the issue could damage the UK capital’s reputation as being open to visitors.

Since Brexit, the UK has been banned from automatic access to personal details of EU residents. Transport authorities in Belgium, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed to the Guardian that driver data cannot be shared with the UK for enforcement of London’s ultra-low emission zone (Ulez), and claim registered keeper details were obtained illegally by agents acting for TfL’s contractor Euro Parking Collection.

In France, more than 100 drivers have launched a lawsuit claiming their details were obtained fraudulently, while Dutch lorry drivers are taking legal action against TfL over £6.5m of fines they claim were issued unlawfully.

According to the Belgian MP Michael Freilich, who has investigated the issue on behalf of his constituents, TfL is treating European drivers as a “cash cow” by using data obtained illegitimately to issue unjustifiable fines.

Many of the penalties have been issued to drivers who visited London in Ulez-compliant vehicles and were not aware they had to be registered with TfL’s collections agent Euro Parking at least 10 days before their visit.

Failure to register does not count as a contravention, according to Ulez rules, but some drivers have nonetheless received penalties of up to five-figure sums. TfL said the fines were justified because it was unable to confirm whether foreign vehicles had contravened emissions standards if they were not registered.

Has London’s Ulez become a magnet for conspiracy theories? – video

Some low-emission cars have been misclassed as heavy goods diesel vehicles and fined under the separate low-emission zone (Lez) scheme, which incurs penalties of up to £2,000 a day. Hundreds of drivers have complained that the fines arrived weeks after the early payment discount and appeals deadlines had passed.

One French driver was fined £25,000 for allegedly contravening Lez and Ulez rules, despite the fact his minibus was exempt.

Freilich has asked ministers to raise the issue during the current Belgian presidency of the Council of the EU. “This is possibly one of the largest privacy and data breaches in EU history, but so far no concrete action has been taken while responsibilities are being shunted on to drivers,” he said.

TfL said that despite an absence of individual data-sharing agreements with EU countries, “local laws” allowed authorities to share vehicle owner information with the UK for the enforcement of traffic regulations.

However, EU countries say national laws allow the UK to access personal data only for criminal offences, not civil ones. Breaching Ulez rules is a civil offence, while more risky behaviour such as speeding or driving under the influence of drink or drugs can be a criminal offence. This raises the question of whether Euro Parking can legally carry out its contract with TfL.

Euro Parking was awarded a five-year contract by TfL in 2020 to recover debts from foreign drivers who had breached congestion or emission zone rules.

The company, which is paid according to its performance, is estimated to have earned between £5m and £10m. It has the option to renew for a further five years.

The firm is owned by the US transport technology group Verra Mobility, which is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and headed by the former Bank of America Merrill Lynch executive David Roberts. The company’s net revenue was $205m (£161m) in the second quarter of 2023.

In October, the Belgian government ordered a criminal investigation after a court bailiff was accused of illegally passing the details of 20,000 drivers to Euro Parking for Ulez enforcement. The bailiff was suspended in 2022 and TfL initially claimed that no Belgian data had been shared with Euro Parking since then. However, a freedom of information request by the Guardian found that more than 17,400 fines had been issued to Belgians in the intervening 19 months.

TfL then claimed driver details were provided directly to Euro Parking by Belgium’s vehicle licensing agency. It has since told the Guardian they are obtained via a National Contact Point (NCP), a network of official information hubs for use by authorised agencies.

However, the Belgian minister for transport has confirmed that data cannot be shared directly or indirectly for Ulez enforcement. Last month, the Belgian data protection authority began an investigation into how the information was still being obtained.

Campaigners accuse Euro Parking of circumventing data protection rules by using EU-based agents to request driver data without disclosing that it is for UK enforcement.

Last year, an investigation by the Dutch vehicle licensing authority RDW found that the personal details of 55,000 citizens had been obtained via an NCP in Italy. “The NCP informed us that the authorised users have used the data in an unlawful way and stopped their access,” a spokesperson said.

The German transport authority KBA claimed that an Italian NCP was used to obtain information from its database. “Euro Parking obtained the data through unlawful use of an EU directive to facilitate the cross-border exchange of information about traffic offences that endanger road safety,” a KBA spokesperson said. “The directive does not include breaches of environmental rules.”

Spain’s transport department told the Guardian that UK authorities were not allowed access to driver details for Ulez enforcement. Euro Parking has sent more than 25,600 fines to Spanish drivers since 2021.

In France, 102 drivers have launched a lawsuit claiming that their details were fraudulently obtained. Romain Binelli, of the law firm Woog & Associés, who is representing the litigants, said: “The question is who could have accessed the information. Either Euro Parking and TfL have maintained their access to the vehicle database, which should have ended after Brexit, or they are paying someone to get the information. Drivers are receiving packets of 10 or more fines for monstrous amounts all at once, often well after the [deadline] date to contest them.”

TfL, speaking on behalf of Euro Parking, said: “Any company working on our behalf is contractually required to ensure that data is processed in line with the relevant data protection legislation. We work closely with European Parking Collection to ensure all elements of the contract are being adhered to and have mechanisms in place should they not be fulfilled.

“Euro Parking make it clear when they submit requests for keeper data in EU countries that they are acting on behalf of TfL, for enforcement of road-user charging in London, even when they route those requests through a third party. Euro Parking has not been prevented from accessing keeper data for drivers in EU countries.”

Caroline Pidgeon, the Lib Dem London assembly member and transport spokesperson, called for an immediate investigation after the Guardian shared its findings.

“It is extremely worrying to hear that TfL could be collecting its data from drivers unlawfully,” she said. “The extent of fines being issued to visitors from the EU, many incorrectly, demonstrates that the rules are not being communicated clearly to tourists, something which I have raised with TfL in the past only to be brushed off. If this issue is not solved urgently, it risks seriously damaging London’s reputation as being open to visitors.”","['euro', 'transport', 'fines', 'eu', 'driving', 'information', 'fined', 'drivers', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'ulez', 'citizens', 'wrongly', 'data', 'parking', 'london', 'tfl']",The Guardian
Superdry loses fourth finance boss in five years as losses widen,"Superdry has parted ways with its fourth finance boss in five years as losses widened at the troubled UK fashion brand.

The company said Shaun Wills, who has been the finance director for three years, is leaving the business and being replaced next week by the interim finance boss Giles David.

Wills was preceded this time around by the interim finance boss Benedict Smith after Nick Gresham left in October 2020, less than two years after taking over from Ed Barker. Wills was on his second stint as Superdry’s finance boss, having first left the business in 2015.

David has previously worked at the struggling businesses McColl’s and the Casual Dining Group, both of which fell into administration. Superdry said he had a “strong track record in consumer-facing businesses where he has operated successfully in turnaround environment”.

David arrives as Superdry warned it was facing another tough year in which it expected results “to reflect the more challenging environment seen to date”.

In delayed half-year results, the company said sales fell 23.5% in the six months to 28 October. In the following 12 weeks to 20 January, sales were down 13.7% led by a 38% dive in wholesale sales.

The group dropped to a loss of £25.3m in the half-year, before a £36.3m one-off benefit, principally the sale of its brand rights in Asia. A year before, the group made a £13.6m underlying loss.

Superdry said its sales had been affected by “milder autumn that persisted through the peak Christmas trading period”. It added that weak consumer demand had also led to “heavy discounting across the sector”.

Before Christmas, Superdry warned that profits would be affected by the mild weather but did not give a figure.

Julian Dunkerton, the founder and chief executive of Superdry who returned via a boardroom coup in 2019 to try to turn the business around, said: “This has clearly been a difficult period for Superdry. A challenging consumer retail market, set against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and some remarkably unseasonal weather conditions have all combined to weaken the financial performance of the group.

“These macro and external factors have been further exacerbated by the underperformance of our wholesale segment. While, to some extent, this was expected due to the decision to exit our US operations and the sale of the brand rights in non-core territories, the segment continues to prove challenging.”

He added that the group had made “significant operational strides” despite its “near-term difficulties”.

Wholesale sales were affected by a decision to exit the US market and “structural changes to the broader market” such as the closure of many department stores.

Superdry said it had stepped up efforts to save costs as it remained almost £29m in debt at the end of its half-year, an improvement from the £38m of net debt a year before.

The company now expects to make £40m in savings this financial year, £5m more than previously expected.

It is also looking to sell its brand rights in further territories and sell off old stock in order to raise cash to reduce its debts.

Last summer, Superdry also turned to Hilco, the specialist retail investor, for a £25m loan at a hefty interest rate of 10.5% plus the Bank of England base rate.","['privacy', 'sales', 'boss', 'newsletter', 'finance', 'business', 'rights', 'fourth', 'group', 'loses', 'widen', 'market', 'superdry', 'losses']",The Guardian
UK homeowners with mental health problems ‘spend less on essentials to pay mortgage’,"Homeowners with mental health problems are more likely to have cut back on food and energy to keep on top of their mortgage payments, a charity set up by the consumer finance champion Martin Lewis has warned.

The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute said its research indicated that as many as 1.3 million people in the UK with mental health problems were spending less on essentials – which also included medicine – in order to afford their mortgage costs, which have in many cases increased sharply after a string of interest rate rises.

The charity found that while many mortgage holders had been forced to cut spending in other areas to keep up with higher repayments, the impact had been particularly acute for the three in 10 mortgage borrowers with mental health problems.

Several hundred thousand people saw their monthly outlay rise last year when their existing mortgage deal expired and they were forced to take out a more costly loan. It is estimated that about 1.6m cheap fixed-rate deals are due to expire in 2024, and while the current home loans rate war will help to soften the blow, these borrowers still typically face a big jump in their payments.

Those with mental health problems were “significantly more likely” than those without such conditions to have taken drastic action in order to cover their mortgage costs, and were also at greater risk of falling into arrears, the charity found.

A YouGov poll of 2,150 UK adults that formed part of the research found that three in 10 (30%) mortgage holders with mental health problems had cut back on essential spending to stay in the black with their mortgage, compared with a fifth (21%) of people without such conditions.

They were also about twice as likely (29% compared with 15%) to have raided their savings in order to keep up with their home loan payments, and to have cut spending on essential maintenance and repairs to their home (27% compared with 14%).

The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute is calling on banks and building societies to proactively identify and contact customers struggling with payments, and make support measures “more inclusive and accessible” for people with mental health problems.

It added: “With 1.6 million more households rolling off fixed-rate deals and facing significant payment hikes in 2024, urgent action from lenders is needed to help more homeowners avoid distress and financial harm.”

The charity’s call coincided with a separate survey from the charity Shelter and the high street bank HSBC showing that two in five (40%) of people who pay a mortgage or rent in England – equivalent to 12 million adults – were worried their housing pressures would get worse this year.

More than half (56%) of those polled reported being kept awake at night in the last year, while 70% said they felt anxious, and about half (49%) said their housing situation had left them feeling hopeless.

A spokesperson for the banking body UK Finance said: “The financial services industry is committed to supporting all customers, and lenders work hard to make it easier for customers to disclose their needs so that they can give them the support they need.

“Lenders are ready to support anyone who is struggling with their mortgage payments, and UK Finance’s Reach Out campaign was launched to raise awareness of the help available. We would encourage anyone worried about their finances to get in contact with their lender to discuss the support available.”","['problems', 'support', 'cut', 'charity', 'health', 'uk', 'payments', 'mortgage', 'essentials', 'spending', 'spend', 'mental', 'pay', 'homeowners']",The Guardian
Car insurance: drivers paying monthly ‘face interest charges of more than 30%’,"Car owners who pay for their insurance monthly rather than with a one-off lump sum are being charged interest of more than 30%, research has found, in what has been described by campaigners as a “poverty premium”.

Insurers give customers the choice of paying one annual premium or breaking it up and paying over the course of the year.

However, while the monthly payments are lower, the total cost is typically higher because the premiums are treated as a loan, and insurers add an interest rate to the payment.

The interest on this arrangement, premium finance, ranged between 20.50% and 36.33%, research by the consumer group Which? found.

It highlighted a policy from the insurer 1st Central that had an interest rate of 36.32% for 18-year-old drivers – meaning they would pay an extra £504 on top of an annual premium of £3,388.

The insurer told Guardian Money that it charged a range of rates between 33.50% and 39.11% but its policies still often appeared as among the cheapest on comparison websites.

Recently, the financial regulator hinted that it could ban the practice. In an interview with the trade magazine Post, the Financial Conduct Authority’s head of car insurance, Matt Brewis, said premium finance was a “poor product”, and that he agreed “wholeheartedly” with those who said it was a poverty premium.

Martin Coppack, the director of Fair By Design, which campaigns for equal pricing, said: “We have two types of markets. One that works for the heathy and the wealthy, and one that penalises you for being poor.

“Many people on low incomes need to have a car, and if you have a car, you have to have car insurance. It’s the law. But, as the research shows, the poorer you are, the more you pay.”

Rocio Concha, the Which? director of policy and advocacy, called on the FCA to outline an action plan to tackle the unfair costs of paying monthly for insurance.

“The regulator should also assess how much it costs firms to provide premium credit, and shouldn’t hesitate to take action against providers charging monthly customers excessive interest rates,” she said.

1st Central said: “At 1st Central, we focus on keeping premiums as low as possible, whether customers are paying monthly or annually. Those who opt to pay monthly will pay slightly more, as it costs more to provide insurance in that way. We work hard to support our customers and recognise that circumstances can change throughout a policy, so we encourage customers to contact us in this eventuality.”","['customers', 'charges', 'paying', 'monthly', 'pay', 'drivers', 'research', 'face', 'policy', 'interest', 'insurance', 'car', 'premium', '30']",The Guardian
Indonesian fruit picker landed in debt bondage challenges Home Office,"When Ismael found himself sleeping rough at York station in the late October cold he struggled to understand how an opportunity to pick berries 7,000 miles from his home had so quickly ended there.

He had left Indonesia less than four months earlier, in July 2022. He was 18 and ready for six months of hard work on a British farm to save for a science degree. “I thought the UK was the best place to work because I could save up a little money and help my parents,” he said.

He had no idea the picking season was already well under way or that he would shortly find himself with no work to do and heavy debts back home.

Ismael’s experience is forming the basis of a test case against the government’s seasonal worker scheme, which argues that the scheme’s design breached his right to be protected from modern slavery and labour exploitation.

The case, brought by the Anti Trafficking and Labour Exploitation Unit (ATLEU) against the Home Office and Defra, is a civil claim for damages which will say he ended up effectively stuck in the UK in debt bondage.

As well as compensation, the unit is looking for a declaration that the scheme breached the teenager’s human rights, which they hope will force the government to adjust it.

Ismael, whose name has been changed as his identity is protected in the case, said he spent two days sleeping rough at York station before finding an underground recruiter on Facebook. He was lent the train fare to Newcastle to take up a job in a Chinese takeaway using his passport as collateral.

Ismael said he was paid £300 a week, working more than 14 hours a day as a chef’s assistant. “There was an empty storage room that just had bins with rubbish and they asked me to live there,” he said. “It was cold, I had no heater or anything.”

He is one of more than 34,000 people who were given a seasonal worker visa in 2022. The scheme was expanded rapidly after a pilot in 2019, despite concerns that it left people vulnerable to exploitation.

More than 200 Indonesian fruit pickers who went to the UK in 2022 asked for diplomatic help after facing difficulties. Many arrived late in the season and found there was not enough work on farms to repay their substantial debts.

Ismael said that in total the cost to him of going to the UK was more than £4,200, which included local hidden fees, such as the down payment to a local broker to guarantee the job. He said he borrowed money from family and that a local recruitment broker lent him £2,500 for the final payment to cover flights and visas as well as other costs.

He said his parents’ home was taken as surety on the debt as well as several original identity and qualification documents that he needed for working again in Indonesia.

The agent, he said, began chasing him for repayments on WhatsApp within a week of arriving. But he was not making the money he hoped.

He said that when work dried up on the first farm he was transferred to another, footing the cost of a £250 taxi because nobody explained transport options. It was just halfway through his expected six months of picking when there was no more work at the final farm, which meant he found himself in York station with just £13 in his pocket.

Around this time, he said, two debt collectors were sent to his parents’ home in Indonesia and “stayed for 24 hours in my garage so my parents couldn’t go anywhere”. He said they were now paying monthly 20% interest on the loan and he felt unable to return.

“I feel like I am in slavery at the moment because all my original documents are being held by the agent, which means if I come back to my country I wouldn’t work because companies need my original documents,” he said.

He said the seasonal worker scheme succeeded for those in countries closer to Britain. “Some of my friends that came here from Kazakhstan, from Ukraine, they paid only for their visa and their ticket. There were no more fees or charges [in their home countries], which means that they could pay [it back] within the first month of work. But it’s really different for us. We need to pay a lot.”

He now lives in London, sharing a small loft with seven other people. Initially he worked cash in hand but has recently been afraid to do that after friends were arrested in an immigration raid.

His initial application to be recognised as a victim of trafficking has been turned down, despite no dispute over its facts.

Ismael’s lawyer, Jamila Duncan-Bosu at ATLEU, said her client’s situation was far from unique and she was looking for others to join his case.

“He’s in such a catch-22 because if he goes back without paying the debt he’s basically not able to work or get into education and that debt will continue to get racked up and he’ll have no way of paying it. Meanwhile he’s stuck. He’s in the UK and he’s essentially been trafficked as a result of being in this position of debt bondage,” she said.

A government spokesperson said: “The welfare of visa holders is of paramount importance, including in the seasonal workers scheme, and we are clamping down on poor working conditions and exploitation.

“We have established a new team within the Home Office compliance network which focuses on ensuring sponsors are abiding by workers’ rights, and will always take decisive action where we believe abusive practices are taking place or the conditions of the route are not met.”","['picker', 'debt', 'indonesian', 'seasonal', 'challenges', 'bondage', 'fruit', 'scheme', 'landed', 'work', 'parents', 'york', 'working', 'worker', 'uk', 'office', 'hes']",The Guardian
The joy of CeX: how to spend £10 in the secondhand gaming mega store,"Feel free to mispronounce Ikea ( it should be ee-kay-uh, from the Swedish) and Lidl (lee-dal, from the German). But there’s no arguing when it comes to CeX, the bright red secondhand technology shop you get in more or less every UK town centre, usually next to McDonald’s, Primark and/or Poundland. It may be short for Complete Entertainment eXchange, but it shouldn’t be pronounced C-E-X, as you might say to your mum when explaining where you got her cheap secondhand mobile phone from. Officially, CeX is pronounced as sex. The pleasure of it is in the sheer incongruous irony – these stores, with their miles of metal shelving and threadbare carpets are as far from the erotic as it’s possible to get. But somehow, they hold a special place in the hearts of all entertainment seekers on a budget.

I am a regular visitor. There are five CeXs within a three-mile radius of my house and they’re extremely handy. The thrill is in never knowing exactly what you’re going to find. For the purposes of this article, the Guardian gave me a generous budget of £10 to discover what bargains lay in store.

But first some history. CeX (no sniggering at the back) was started in 1992 by a group that weirdly included writer and broadcaster Charlie Brooker, when he was still a games journalist writing for PC Zone magazine. The first branch opened near Tottenham Court Road, but there’s now 390 UK stores and a further 230 worldwide. Yes, before you ask, there is a CeX store on the Canaries – just in case, on your next summer holiday, you find yourself needing a copy of Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker for the Nintendo Switch.

And yet, there’s always been something a bit fishy about CeX. Some people cling on to the idea that the place is full of stolen laptops and mobiles. But, no: CeX checks all items against a stolen goods database, so don’t get any ideas.

As well as the shops, you can also buy online from a giant database of all 390 UK shops. Phones and laptops are priced according to their grade (A - mint to F - non-functioning). Consoles come boxed, unboxed or discounted. Everything comes as a standard price. You do however pay more for stuff in CeX than you would buying privately. For example, CeX sells a £480 RRP boxed 1TB PlayStation 5 Slim Console for £390 – you could get one on eBay or Gumtree for around £300. The trade-off is everything CeX sells comes with a 24-month free warranty.

They also do retro consoles. Online you can find a 1992 Super Nintendo for £65 and a 2009 500GB PS3 Slim for £85 and a 2013 500GB Xbox One for £105. Alongside brand new games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 for £50 on the PS5 and Super Mario Bros: Wonders on the Switch for £45, you’ll see shelves crammed with games for outdated consoles such as the PS3 and DS, priced for as little as £1. (Be careful though with backward compatibility – you can’t play PS3 games on a PS4 or PS5, for example, so you’ll need the original consoles).There are also plenty of DVDs and Blu-rays, some less than £1, thanks to the bottom completely collapsing out of the physical media movie market with the advent of streaming, , but these will still play on your PS4 and PS5.

“The main thing that affects price is how many copies we have in stock,” explains my local helpful CeX man (who prefers to remain anonymous). “The more popular the game, the more we’ll have in stock and the cheaper they’ll be.” Almost all of the Call of Duty and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare PS3 games are on sale for £1. “If they’re part of an evolving series” – like Pro Evolution Soccer – “they’ll be cheap too. People come in with bags of games to sell. We have to put a price on everything – from £50 to 50p.” Certain games also hold their value indefinitely thanks to a rabid fanbase of collectors. Pokémon, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil can all come in anywhere between £20 and £100, while super rare titles on old consoles can go for more. A mint copy of Vib Ribbon on the PSOne, where you move your character in time with the music from your actual CDs, will cost you £120, a mint copy of Snatcher, the Mega CD cyberpunk adventure by Hideo Kojima will cost you £625, while a vanishingly obscure PAL copy of the N64 title Snowboard Kids 2 could be a grand.

While we’re chatting, I take the chance to quiz Mr CeX on some store policies. For example, what are the limits on the 24-month warranty? “Obviously it doesn’t cover customer damage,” he replies. What happens if something has just been stolen and so not logged on any stolen databases? “We’d have no knowledge so we’d buy it.” What if it’s reported stolen afterwards? A slight pause. “That doesn’t really happen.”

What’s the weirdest thing someone has tried to sell? “A pair of shoes,” he says. “People think we’re a pawn shop and buy anything, like hair straighteners … which we actually do buy. There’s some here for £45 if you’re interested?” I would be, had I any hair and it didn’t take me massively over budget. I could do with an extra PS3 controller, but the cheapest – a Dual Shock 3 – is £25. “Christmas wiped us out of controllers, even though they’re expensive,” he says. But I can afford to buy the PS3 Eye Camera and microphone for £1 each. So I do.

Back home, I’m rather pleased with my haul. Let’s break it down:

View image in fullscreen Purchases from Rich Pelley’s trip to the famed store … Photograph: Rich Pelley

1. The original Call 0f Duty Modern Warfare 3 (PS3) – a steal at £1.

2. EyePet (PS3) – just £1 to watch a virtual pet crawl around my own living room in augmented Eye Camera reality.

3. SingStar Take That (PS3) – £1 to belt out Never Forget and Back for Good with Howard, Gary, Jason and Mark.

4. Get Fit with Mel B (PS3)– another quid well spent, although shouldn’t it have been Sporty Spice?

5. PES 2009 (PS3) – just 50p and only 15 years out of date.

6. PS3 Eye Camera and microphone for £1 each

This left me with £3.50, so in order to meet my brief and spend the agreed amount, I bought Dumb & Dumber To on DVD for £1.50 and Rise of the Planet of the Apes on Blu-ray for a bargain 75p. This – with the £1.20 I spent on a sausage roll next door at Greggs – put me 5p under my £10 budget. Bargain.

These stores may sometimes be a little tatty around the edges, but with a full stomach and several hours’ worth of semi-retro entertainment, who am I to complain? In short: CeX sells and I’m buying.","['copy', 'mega', 'gaming', 'theres', 'secondhand', 'ps3', 'store', 'duty', 'games', 'stolen', 'joy', 'buy', 'warfare', 'consoles', 'spend', 'cex']",The Guardian
Domestic wood burners having a deadly impact in outside areas,"Scientists are starting to count the health cost of heating our homes with wood. One study, in Canberra in Australia, has found that deaths from everyday exposure to smoke from wood burners is comparable with those during the unprecedented “black summer” bushfires of 2019/2020.

Prof Sotiris Vardoulakis, part of the research team and director of the Healthy Environments and Lives (Heal) National Research Network, described winter in the city: “When I take my two boys to play basketball outdoors in winter, or when we walk the dog before dinner, there is always a smell of wood smoke in the air.”

Vardoulakis and his team found that wood-heating was causing up to a quarter of the particle pollution in Canberra. Combining this information on the health harm from air pollution, they estimated that between 17 and 63 deaths were attributable annually to wood smoke in the Australian Capital Territory, which has a population of about 450,000.

This shortening of life means an annual loss of A$92m to A$333m (£48m to £173m) to Australian society. The health impact of this regular winter burning was comparable to the deaths during the 2019-2020 “black summer” bushfires from smoke.

Vardoulakis said: “Canberra suffers from winter pollution, largely due to wood-heaters. There are many complaints from families with asthma, but also from people without chronic health conditions. They feel hopeless. They cannot open their windows in winter or spend any time outdoors due to the wood smoke.

“The most effective way to reduce community exposure to smoke is by not permitting new wood-heater installations and phasing out existing units. These findings are transferable to other residential areas, where wood burning takes place in the colder months of the year.”

Separate research has estimated that 284 Londoners are dying early each year due to outdoor air pollution from solid-fuel heating. In Greece, many people switched from oil to wood heating during the country’s financial crisis in winter 2012-2013. A study in Thessaloniki found about 200 extra deaths due to the resulting increases in air pollution.

Measurements in homes, including those in the UK, show that stoves and fireplaces increase particle pollution indoors. This adds to pollution from other sources, including cooking and tobacco smoking, but it is less studied compared with outdoor exposure.

A recent study of 50,000 women in the US showed a 43% greater chance of lung cancer for those people who used wood heating compared with those who did not. Increased cognitive impairment, a common symptom of dementia, has also been found in people who use solid-fuel heating in several countries, including China and Ireland.

To understand the overall size of these indoor impacts, two researchers from the University of Lisbon have been estimating how much heating a home with a wood stove or fireplace shortens the lives of the occupants.

Dr Nuno Martins explained what prompted their research: “The initial idea came from hearing a podcast that had Guardian columnist George Monbiot as a guest. We looked more into it and found that there wasn’t much data on how much particle pollution was released by wood-burning equipment into homes.”

Martins and his team started by measuring air pollution from stoves and fireplaces in a small number of homes. This data was used in computer simulations of three homes in north-west Europe: in Birmingham, Groningen and Copenhagen, and combined with data from the health effects of outdoor air pollution.

Heating a living-room open fireplace for four hours each winter’s evening was estimated to shorten the occupant’s life expectancy by between one and 1.6 years. Using a stove could reduce overall life expectancy by up to six months.

This comes with important caveats. Indoor and outdoor air pollution have different sources; chemical composition and exposure. Less is known about how to calculate the impact of air pollution that we breathe in our homes, but the research could help scientists understand the approximate extent of the health impact on people with stoves and fireplaces, as well as possible solutions.

Martins said: “The main message is that open fireplaces should be avoided. An improvement would be to replace them with closed woodstoves or, ideally, replace wood-burning equipment completely.”","['impact', 'areas', 'homes', 'outside', 'smoke', 'having', 'pollution', 'burners', 'heating', 'health', 'domestic', 'research', 'winter', 'outdoor', 'air', 'deadly', 'wood']",The Guardian
‘The world is changing too fast for us’: organic farmers on urgency of French protests,"Pierre Bretagne woke at 4am to feed the cows on his organic farm near the coastal town of Pornic in western France, then did something he had never dared to before.

He made a cardboard protest banner about the nightmare of French bureaucracy and went to cheer on a go-slow convoy of tractors warning that French farming and the rural way of life was facing collapse. Effigies of dead farmers dangled from nooses on tractor trailers as the convoy drove into the centre of the Brittany city of Rennes, beeping horns and waving banners. “Quality has a price,” read one.

“We’re fed up and exasperated,” says Bretagne, 38. “I love my job – I farm organically because it’s what I believe in and it’s the right thing ethically and in terms of health. In nine years of farming, I’ve never been on a protest; I’d rather be with my animals. But things are getting so difficult – we need decent prices that reflect not just the quality of our produce but the love we put into this job and into the countryside. This is a passion, a vocation, but we don’t get the recognition for it.”

The French government has been taken by surprise by the scale and fury of grassroots farmer demonstrations that have spread from the south-west across the whole country this week.

00:01:29 Farmers block roads across Europe to protest against regulations and costs – video report

Bales of hay and tractors have been used to block main highways; manure has been sprayed on public buildings and supermarkets in the south-west. Crates of tomatoes, cabbages and cauliflowers that farmers said had been cheaply imported were dumped across roads. Although the protests follow other demonstrations by European farmers in countries including Germany and Romania, the French protests have a particularly urgent and local political flavour. France, the EU’s biggest agricultural producer, has thousands of independent producers of meat, dairy, fruit and vegetables and wine, who have a reputation for staging disruptive protests.

For several months, angry farmers had been turning street signs upside-down in villages across France in protest, while Marine Le Pen’s far-right party travelled the country to court rural voters.

But in Paris, Emmanuel Macron’s appointment earlier this month as the new prime minister, Gabriel Attal, instead focused on issues such as law and order and introducing trials of school uniform. Now the farming protests are Attal’s first significant headache, only five months before European parliament elections where the far right in France could make gains.

On Thursday, Breton fishers joined in; other trade union workers could follow if a social protest movement grows. After the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) citizen protest movement of 2018 and 2019, the government is so sensitive that it has directed riot police to act in moderation, rather than dismantle roadblocks. The demonstrators have many demands: including ensuring fairer prices for produce, continuing diesel tax-breaks for agricultural vehicles, an end to the extra French red tape layered on top of EU rules and immediate aid for struggling organic farmers.

Polls show massive public support for the farmers’ protest – up to 90% – but farmers say that French consumers, struggling to make ends meet and bamboozled by supermarkets, do not always choose French produce in shops.

As organic farming faces an acute crisis in France, with sales dropping sharply, Bretagne says it has taken an emotional toll. “In human terms, it’s a catastrophe,” he says of the loneliness and isolation that some farmers have faced. From a farming family, his own father died “exhausted” at 60, having been unable to adapt to the changing industry. Bretagne earned only €600–€700 (£512-£597) a month, and sold much of his organic produce – beef, free-range chicken and sunflower products – as conventional rather than organic produce because the market was so hard.

“People see organic food as too expensive, but organic farmers are not getting the big margins on shop prices,” he says. “Where are those profits going? Who is lining their pockets?”

Bretagne’s wife’s salary as a support worker for adults with disabilities kept him and their two children afloat. But for him, farming was about being present in the countryside, keeping rural communities alive. He says: “The world is changing too fast for us. We don’t know where we are.”

The farming union, Coordination Rurale, which organised protests in Rennes on Thursday, gave its demonstrators yellow hats, an echo of the gilets jaunes.

Natacha Guillemet, 50, from Vouvant in the Vendée, says she farmed grass-fed Parthenais cattle for high-quality “red label” beef sold in top Paris butchers’ shops. “But at the end of the month, I line up the bills on the mantlepiece and decide which ones to pay because I can’t pay all of them,” she says.

“I’m counting stamps on envelopes, I’m counting euros. We are not in dairy, but we milk some cows to provide some milk for our children. The prices paid by intermediaries for our produce are too low and yet our costs are exploding: diesel, insurance. Consumers are getting charged a lot but we’re not seeing that deferential. There’s a lack of dignity.”

Sometimes, she says, it felt like working in a feudal system: “It’s as if we get the crumbs … We’re being taken for fools.”

Olivier Chemin, 54, an organic dairy farmer at Saint-Fraimbault-de-Prières in Mayenne, says: “This anger has been on slow-burn for years in France – there has been a distortion of competition, prices are low. I’ve been farming for 22 years. Organic dairy costs more to produce, yet prices are dropping.

“The demonstrations are about the future of French farming and rural life. It’s about how we feed ourselves, the quality of our food. It’s very seriously under threat from imports that don’t respect European or French rules. If the government doesn’t act, farming will collapse.”

Chemin says suicide rates are up among smaller farmers, some of whom earn just €500 a month. He says small-scale French farmers, who work more than 60 hours a week, spend hours each week filling out paperwork and dealing with red tape.

Michelle Mone and the PPE Medpro investigation - podcast,"After the peer admitted to lying about her involvement in lucrative government PPE deals during the Covid crisis, the fate of her high-profile lingerie company raises further questions. David Conn reports

When Michelle Mone sat down for an interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg last month it was against the backdrop of serious allegations that she had been facing since 2020. Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based businessman Doug Barrowman, are the subjects of a long-running National Crime Agency investigation into allegations of bribery and fraud in their securing of £200m in government contracts for a company, PPE Medpro.

She admitted to Kuenssberg that she had lied for years when denying her involvement in the lucrative PPE deals, emphasising in the interview that she was a ‘very successful individual businesswoman’.

The Guardian investigations correspondent, David Conn, tells Nosheen Iqbal that the admission of lying was welcome but that the interview raised other questions.

Mone rose to prominence through her lingerie company, Ultimo, which harnessed the power of a new age of celebrity culture. In August 2015, Cameron appointed her as his ‘entrepreneurship tsar’ and gave her a peerage later the same month. But questions remain about the success of the company, which documents show had been heading for insolvency until it was rescued by a Sri Lankan clothing manufacturer, MAS Holdings.

A spokesperson for Mone, Barrowman and PPE Medpro responded to questions from the Guardian for this story. They said: ‘Michelle was honoured to be asked to join the House of Lords by David Cameron after her role in the Scottish referendum campaign. Her appointment was duly vetted by the House of Lords appointments commission at the time.’

The spokesperson added: ‘Any suggestion that Michelle ran a successful lingerie company for many years but did not have any experience in manufacturing is laughable.’

Neither Cameron nor Iain Duncan Smith responded to invitations to comment. A Cabinet Office spokesperson pointed out that all peerages were vetted by House of Lords appointments commission.","['questions', 'house', 'medpro', 'spokesperson', 'company', 'ppe', 'lords', 'mone', 'podcast', 'michelle', 'investigation', 'lingerie', 'interview']",The Guardian

"Private rents in Great Britain hit record high, data shows","Average private rents in Great Britain have climbed to new record highs, though in some regions there has been a small fall in the amount new tenants are being asked to pay, data shows.

The typical advertised private rent outside London for new properties coming on to the market rose to a record £1,280 a calendar month in the final quarter of 2023, according to the property website Rightmove. That is £2 higher than the £1,278 figure recorded in the third quarter – a sign that rental growth is slowing.

The average advertised rent outside London was 9.2% higher than a year ago but there were early signs that there could be “a better experience for many tenants trying to secure a rental property” this year, Rightmove said.

The seemingly relentless rise in rental costs has been adding to pressure on households, though the website said there was evidence that more tenants were hitting an “affordability ceiling”, with an increasing number of landlords having to lower asking prices.

The average London rent also reached a new high of £2,631, though the annual rate of rental growth in the capital had halved in recent months.

The Rightmove data suggests the overall figures disguise wide regional variations, with some locations still experiencing runaway increases and others small falls in the typical sums paid by new tenants.

Annual rental growth in hotspots such as Walton-on-Thames in Surrey, Coventry and Luton is 36.8%, 24.9% and 21% respectively. Other areas reporting growth of at least 20% include Preston in Lancashire, Dundee, and Salford, Greater Manchester.

The data also showed that in three regions – south-east England, the south-west and Scotland – the average advertised rent fell slightly, by 0.4-0.9% in October to December 2023 compared with the previous three months.

The trends of property supply improving and tenant demand easing are continuing. The number of people contacting letting agents about a move is 13% lower than the same period last year, while the number of new rental properties coming on to the market is 7% higher.

The data showed that almost a quarter (23%) of properties had their initially advertised rent reduced – up from 16% on this time last year – suggesting that in some cases asking prices were “increasingly out of reach for some tenants”, Rightmove said.

Tim Bannister, the website’s director of property science, said: “The trend of rent growth gradually slowing continues, with an improvement in the supply and demand of rental properties having a big contribution to that.

“We can’t keep seeing double-digit rent rises every year as tenant affordability simply cannot keep up, and 2024 is the year we think there will be a much smaller increase in advertised rents of 5% outside London and 3% in the capital.”","['hit', 'private', 'high', 'rent', 'advertised', 'rents', 'tenants', 'property', 'growth', 'rightmove', 'britain', 'record', 'rental', 'great', 'data', 'properties', 'shows', 'london']",The Guardian
Bernie Ecclestone's £650m fraud payout 'made him second biggest taxpayer in UK',"A £650m fraud settlement agreed by former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone made him the second-biggest taxpayer in the UK last year, according to the Sunday Times Tax List.

The 93-year billionaire businessman was spared jail last after admitting failing to declare more than £400m held in a trust in Singapore to the government.

He agreed to settle £652.6m over tax he was meant to pay to HM Revenue & Customs during 18 years starting in 1994.

As a result, the tax list researchers said Mr Ecclestone was the second-highest individual taxpayer in the country.

The top slot was taken by Alex Gerko, a Russian-born financial trader and founder of XTX Markets, at £664.5m.

Third on the list were Denise, John and Peter Coates, the family behind online gambling giant Bet365. They paid £375.9m.

The gambling fortune of Fred and Peter Done and family put them in fourth place at £204.6m, closely followed by Wetherspoon founder Sir Tim Martin on £167.1m.

The youngest single taxpayer to make the top 100 list was singer Ed Sheeran, 32, who paid £39.6m to the exchequer.

The boxer Anthony Joshua was a new entry on the list this year, paying an estimated £12.2m.

In total, the 100 individuals and families paid £5.3bn in tax - 3.3% more than a year ago.

But the bumper contributions by Mr Gerko and Mr Ecclestone are stripped out, the total from the remaining 98 entries is down by £200m - the same amount the government pledged to the NHS to boost winter resilience.

The researchers said that Akshata Murty, the wife of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, was liable for tax of around £4.8m after she gave up her non-dom status following political pressure. It was not enough to get her included on the list.

Rents hit record high but signs of a slowdown in market as tenants reach limit of what can pay,"Average asking rents outside of London hit a record £1,280 per month towards the end of last year, according to a property website.

Rightmove, which released the index covering Britain, said agents are typically receiving 11 enquiries for every rental property.

However, there are indications the market may have reached its peak with 2024 expected to see a slowdown in rent hikes.

Money latest: How we made almost £1,000 in three months switching banks

A 0.2% quarterly increase in asking rents in the last three months of 2023 was the smallest rise since 2019.

There have also been signs more tenants are reaching the limit of what they can pay, with nearly a quarter (23%) of rental properties needing a reduction in advertised rent, compared with 16% a year earlier.

Advertised rents in the final quarter of 2023 were, on average, 9.2% higher than a year earlier.

Despite the increase, Rightmove said it was the lowest annual growth in rents seen since 2021.

In London, asking rents also hit a record high, at £2,631 per month on average.

This was a 0.2% quarterly increase, and 6.1% higher than a year earlier.

Rightmove said it was the first time annual growth in asking rents in London had been in single digits since 2021.

It predicts rents will be 5% higher outside London by the end of 2024, and 3% up in London.

One of the main contributors to the slowing of rent rises is an improvement in the balance of supply and demand in the rental market, the website said.

But it added the rental market is still very busy compared with pre-coronavirus pandemic levels.

Hayley Brinn, director at the Total Letting Service, said: ""The market is still really busy, and the high number of applicants per property is being exacerbated by some landlords leaving the market.

""Prices appear to be levelling out now as more choice becomes available, with tenants becoming more price-sensitive, or just reaching the maximum of what they can afford to pay. The prices of larger properties in particular are slowing down, unless the landlord accepts an offer.

""Some tenants are reluctant to move unless they have no choice, due to the risk of being charged higher rents elsewhere, while other tenants who may want to move are stuck due to their current rent being below market value, and the price gap to move to a larger house is out of their reach.

Kaman Aerospace: Why The Take Over Is The Best Thing That Could Happen (NYSE:KAMN),"Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images News

In October 2023, I initiated coverage of Kaman Corporation (NYSE:KAMN) with a hold rating. Since then, quite a few things have changed, as the company received a bid to be taken private by Arcline. In this report, I discuss why being taken private was the best course of business for Kaman Corp.

Arcline Bid Values Kaman At $1.8 Billion

Arcline Investment Management, a private equity firm, has offered $46 per share in an all-cash transaction, giving the company a total enterprise value of $1.8 billion. Arcline Investment Management is a private equity firm focused on growth-oriented investment opportunities in the fields of biopharmaceutical technology, defense, aerospace, energy transition and specialty materials. The acquisition of Kaman Corp. is set to be completed in the first half of 2024 and the acquisition price provides a 105% premium over Kaman's closing price before the acquisition was made public.

Kaman Stockholders Got A Good Deal

One major reason why I believe investors got a good deal is because Kaman had significant debt maturing in 2024 and when I went through the company's investor presentations and results, it was not in the slightest clear how the company would be handling this debt. Its most recent cash and cash equivalents balance was $30.1 million, while its free cash flow was unlikely to be running in the hundreds of millions of dollars, which is what the company needed to pay down its $562.5 million in debt maturing.

Kaman Corp.

In Kaman's 2022 annual report, the company pointed at a possible issuance of 3.1 million shares in case the convertible notes would be settled by a debt-to-equity conversion. This would result in a 10% dilution of shareholders. The other option would be exploring refinancing options, but one can wonder how successful the company would be in arranging refinancing in the current interest rate environment.

So, solely looking at the debt, Kaman Corporation being taken private and getting a premium for the shares is a true blessing for shareholders.

The Aerospace Forum

Another reason why I believe a $46 offer is a sweet deal is the fact that when processing the forward projections for Kaman Corporation back in October, there was no scenario where the company's shares would be worth $46 a stand-alone business:

I ran the numbers for Kaman and driven by its weak three-year alpha, the company is a hold rather than a buy. Upside, however, does exist with 66% upside compared to a median industry valuation and 26% compared to its company median. Given that the company currently is trading at a multiple that's significantly higher than the industry median, I would put a $31 price target on the stock with the note that in case the $199.5 million convertible notes due 2024 are not exercised and are fully paid off, Kaman will need to dip it its existing credit lines to pay for the notes on maturity. The company already has positioned for that by extending the maturity on the credit agreement to 2028, allowing the company to borrow from the credit line to pay for the notes.

Generally, I am looking for a premium of around 30% compared to peer valuation, and the acquisition price of $46 provides a 29.5% premium against my valuation for 2024. So, that is a great deal for shareholders in my view and the deal is even better when considering the median EV/EBITDA for the company providing a 55 to 70 percent premium based on 2025 and 2024 earnings as a reference.

Conclusion: Shareholders Got A Great Deal For A Mediocre Performer

When I analyzed Kaman Corporation in October, I could see the positive industry tailwinds but failed to see a tangible plan by the company to turn the current business environment into a sustained success while debt maturities were closing in. I do believe that the current bid for $46 is a great deal for investors and the best that could happen. Indeed, pre-pandemic this was a $60 stock, but in the current setting, there was no way in which such a stock price could be once again be achieved and management probably also had significant challenges seeing a value-creating path ahead.","['thing', 'deal', 'private', 'price', 'debt', 'happen', '46', 'company', 'kaman', 'nysekamn', 'best', '2024', 'aerospace', 'million', 'premium']",Seeking Alpha
Canadian National Railway: A Great Buy On Weakness (NYSE:CNI),"ilbusca

All financial numbers in this article are in Canadian dollars unless noted otherwise.

Introduction

Earnings season is heating up! This usually means we put a bigger emphasis on railroads, defense companies, machinery producers, financials, and other stocks that are both great economic indicators and fantastic long-term investments.

In this article, we start the railroad earnings season with one of the best North American railroads. That company is the Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI), the largest competitor of Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CP), which is a holding of my dividend growth portfolio.

The only reason why I do not own CNI shares is the fact that I own three other railroads already. In addition to Canadian Pacific, I own Union Pacific (UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NSC), which means I have Canadian exposure, ""mid-America"" exposure, and a wide variety of goods, including bulk, merchandise, and intermodal.

Association of American Railroads

With that in mind, after writing a series of neutral articles last year, my most recent article was bullish when I gave the stock a Buy rating, using the title ""Canadian National Has Entered The Buy Zone: Navigating Challenges, Embracing Opportunity.""

Since then, CNI shares have returned 21%, beating the S&P 500 by roughly 600 basis points.

Data by YCharts

As the company just released its Q4'23 earnings, there's no better moment to reiterate the bull case and focus on the value this stock brings to the table for long-term investors.

Also, if you do not own CNI stock, we will also learn a lot about economic developments and what this may mean for other railroad earnings down the road.

So, let's get to it!

The Bigger Picture

Before we dive into any numbers, let me quickly give you a quick look at the bigger picture.

While the U.S. economy is not in a recession, we are seeing headwinds in cyclical industries.

For example, leading economic surveys like the Philadelphia and New York Federal Reserve manufacturing surveys point to a further contraction in manufacturing, which does not bode well for industrial companies like railroads.

After all, railroads are among the most cyclical companies, as they connect players in almost all supply chains.

Here's what the average of the Philly Fed and New York Fed surveys looks like:

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED)

Again, while we're not in a recession yet, we are seeing signs that we may come closer to a recession.

For example, using the chart of a friend of mine, we see a few indicators that point to a recession:

The ""cost of money"" is rolling over, hinting at expected rate cuts.

The yield curve is slowly becoming uninverted, which is a recession signal.

The ISM Manufacturing Index (highly correlated to the regional Fed surveys I just used) is close to recession levels as well.

If regional surveys are right, the ISM index may be at recession levels when it reports new numbers in early February.

Twitter: @MacroTechnicals

Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to get people to sell anything.

I have not been a net seller of stocks since I started to build a larger long-term portfolio. I also hold no shorts.

The only change I made going into this year is holding a bigger cash position. I increased my savings rate and now hold roughly 15% cash, which I want to use in case economic conditions cause a stock market correction.

If I did not have so much railroad exposure already, CNI would be on my buy list.

Strength Amid Weakness

In light of economic conditions, the company did well.

Despite a 2% decline in fourth-quarter revenues, key operational metrics, such as Revenue Ton-Miles (RTMs), increased by 2%, indicating operational resilience.

Canadian National Railway

Diving into the details, as we can see in the overview below, petroleum and chemical volumes showed a significant increase of 12%, excluding crude oil.

The metals and minerals segment experienced a 3% growth in RTMs, with positive trends across various components, except for iron ore, where RTMs were down due to a shift in shipment patterns.

Bulk shipments, particularly fertilizers, witnessed a substantial 85% increase, as the company handled incremental domestic and record potash exports using its available capacity in the Eastern and Southern regions.

Coal performance varied, with Canadian coal up 5% and U.S. coal down 9%. Forest product volumes, however, were down by 5%, reflecting softer market conditions.

The table below gives you a full overview of these numbers, including total freight revenues, total RTMs, freight revenue per RTM, and carloads.

Canadian National Railway

With regard to consumer-focused goods, the international intermodal faced challenges, with an 11% decrease, primarily attributed to the lingering effects of a port strike.

However, domestic intermodal showed resilience, mitigating market softness through the implementation of company-specific initiatives such as Falcon and EMP.

EMP, for example, is its program to improve intermodal operations, partnering with Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern to create a network that benefits all three players in North America.

Canadian National Railway

Meanwhile, the company's Falcon Premium service is a collaboration with Union Pacific and GrupoMéxico to get better access to Mexico's market.

This is a measure to benefit from economic re-shoring, Mexico's increasing importance in the rail industry, and to compete with Canadian Pacific, which now owns the first network covering all three North American nations through a single railroad.

Canadian National Railway

Furthermore, with regard to the economic environment, despite a 2% decline in fourth-quarter revenues, the company is optimistic about a gradual return to pre-COVID volume levels.

Factors contributing to this outlook include increased drilling in Northeast BC, new interline partnerships targeting truck volumes, and positive expectations in the economy, particularly in lumber and panels.

Speaking of improvements, the company improved its operations even further, which is critical in an industry that battled inefficiencies after the pandemic, although this impacted U.S. railroads more than the two Canadian railroads.

In addition to achieving a record-low industry rate among employees, the company achieved an origin train performance of 90%. However, during its earnings call, the company mentioned room for improvement in destination train performance, which stood at 70%.

Furthermore, the impact of the new Canadian Work/Rest Rules on crew scheduling added new complexities, which require more efforts to improve operations.

Nonetheless, there was also good news:

Car velocity averaged 215 miles per day in Q4, a 4% improvement over the previous year.

Dwell time showed a notable 4% improvement over the same period.

Network train speed, while flat in Q4 compared to the previous year, demonstrated a 5% improvement on a full-year basis.

Canadian National Railway

On top of all of this, the company is taking more radical steps to improve its business, including the acquisition of CBNS, which is expected to provide opportunities to densify the eastern part of the network in the coming years.

We are proud to be partnering with Genesee & Wyoming to serve existing customers on this line. This partnership will further reinforce CN's presence in eastern Canada where we believe there will be a growing role to play in the competitiveness of North American trade. It will also enable our network to reach new opportunities in the longer-term, further advancing our strategic agenda of accelerating profitable, sustainable growth. - Canadian National

Additionally, the agreement to purchase Iowa Northern is viewed as a positive step, as it will enhance market access in the Midwest and deepen the network reach, particularly in the Ag business sector.

IANR serves upper Midwest agricultural and industrial markets covering many goods, including biofuels and grain. This transaction represents a meaningful opportunity to support the growth of local business by creating single-line service to North American destinations, while preserving access to existing carrier options. - Canadian National

With all of this said, the bottom line during the quarter was weak, as the company reported a 4% decrease in adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year.

The operating ratio for the quarter stood at 59.3%, which was a deterioration of 140 basis points.

Canadian National Railway

As these numbers were decent - especially in light of economic challenges - the Board of Directors approved a 7% dividend increase for 2024, marking the 28th consecutive year of dividend growth.

Additionally, a new share buyback program of up to 32 million shares, totaling around $4 billion, was announced.

Canadian National Railway

This program is scheduled to run from February 1st, 2024, to January 31st, 2025.

Essentially, the decision to increase shareholder value through both dividend payments and share repurchases demonstrates the company's commitment to returning value to its investors through direct distributions and indirect distributions that improve the per-share value of the business.

After hiking its dividend by 7%, it now pays $0.845 per share per quarter. This translates to a yield of 2.0%.

The five-year dividend CAGR is 12%.

Over the past ten years, CNI has bought back more than a fifth of its shares and more than tripled its dividend.

Data by YCharts

With that said, what about its future?

Looking Ahead & Valuation

During its earnings call, the company highlighted its outlook as well, as it expects a more favorable economy in 2024.

It highlighted the expectation of mid-single-digit volume growth based on various factors, such as the aforementioned increased drilling in Northeast BC, new interline partnerships, and positive economic developments.

The company expects to achieve about 10% EPS growth in 2024 compared to 2023.

Analysts agree with the company.

Using the data in the chart below:

Analysts expect the company to grow its EPS by 11% this year, followed by 13% growth in 2025 and 11% growth in 2026.

While these numbers are subject to change, they hint at very consistent growth that would warrant a valuation multiple slightly above its long-term normalized EPS multiple of 18.1x.

Since 2016, CNI has consistently traded close to 20x earnings, which is a valuation that makes sense if it is able to maintain double-digit annual EPS growth backed by tailwinds like economic re-shoring, a stronger intermodal network, and secular tailwinds in commodity shipments like fertilizers.

FAST Graphs

Purely based on the numbers above, the company's implied annual return is 7.8% through 2026, based on a 20x multiple, its dividend, and its expected EPS trajectory.

Since 2003, Toronto-based CNR shares have returned 15% per year, allowing the stock to outperform the market.

Data by YCharts

With that said, I'm struggling a bit with what rating to give the stock.

On a long-term basis, I remain bullish on CNI, as I believe it is one of the best railroads in North America, capable of consistent dividend growth, buybacks, and capital gains.

After its recent stock price surge, a lot of good news has been priced in, while double-digit EPS growth in 2024 could be at risk if leading indicators like the ISM Manufacturing Index do not bottom soon.

Based on these findings, I decided to go back to a Neutral rating, which I will upgrade if the stock were to decline 10% to 15%, improving the risk/reward, or if we get strong signs of an economic bottom over the next three months.

In other words, if I did not have significant railroad exposure, I would closely watch CNI here for a potential entry in the months ahead, as I believe economic conditions could pave the way for a correction.

Takeaway

Despite the challenging economic environment, Canadian National Railway showed resilience in its fourth quarter.

Despite a 2% decline in revenues, operational metrics like Revenue Ton-Miles increased by 2%, proving the company's strength amid weakness.

While the bottom line saw a 4% decrease in adjusted earnings per share, the Board's approval of a 7% dividend increase for 2024 marks the 28th consecutive year of dividend growth. This commitment to shareholder value is further emphasized by a new share buyback program.

Looking ahead, CNI projects a more favorable economy in 2024, expecting mid-single-digit volume growth and a 10% EPS increase. Analysts support this outlook, anticipating consistent growth beyond 2024.

However, due to the recent stock price surge and economic developments, I believe some caution is warranted, making CNI a better buy on potential weakness.","['canadian', 'numbers', 'economic', 'earnings', 'railway', 'growth', 'company', 'cni', 'buy', 'nysecni', 'great', 'weakness', 'national', 'stock', 'dividend']",Seeking Alpha
KPN Stock: The 5.4% Yield Will Increase By A 7% CAGR Until 2027 (OTCMKTS:KKPNF),"oliver de la haye/iStock Editorial via Getty Images

Introduction

KPN (OTCPK:KKPNF) (OTCPK:KKPNY) is the largest telecom company in The Netherlands. The operating and financial performance has been better than I had expected in the past few years and in my article from approximately a year ago I highlighted the attractive dividend yield. The share price has lost approximately 5% since that article and now KPN has published its 2024-2027 outlook, I think dividend growth investors could now be very interested in the stock.

Yahoo Finance

KPN’s listing on Euronext Amsterdam is the most liquid listing. The company is trading in Amsterdam with KPN as its ticker symbol and the average daily trading volume exceeds 11 million shares. As there are just under 4 billion shares outstanding, the current market capitalization is approximately 12.5B EUR.

The cash flow remains strong, and the capex is still reasonable

The set-up of this article will be slightly different as KPN does not publish detailed financial statements on a quarterly basis. That’s why I will first take a step back to have a look at its first half results before discussing the trading update on the third quarter of last year and the subsequent capital markets day where the company provided a longer-term outlook.

During the first semester, KPN reported total revenue of 2.66B EUR which was an increase of just under 2% compared to the first half of the preceding year. Fortunately the company was also able to keep its operating expenses under control and the total amount of operating expenses decreased by approximately 1% resulting in an increase of the operating profit by approximately 10%.

KPN Investor Relations

That was great, but the Dutch telecom company also had to deal with increasing interest expenses. As you can see above the net interest expenses increased from 97M EUR in H1 2022 to 115M EUR in H1 2023 but the total finance expenses actually decreased due to the lower amount of ""other financial results."" The latter is related to the lower hedge ineffectiveness losses and an adjustment to the fair value on the deferred purchase price of an asset.

This means KPN posted very robust results and the company’s bottom line indicates a net profit of 412M EUR which, divided over 4 billion shares, represents an EPS of 0.10 EUR per share.

The company’s cash flows also remained very strong. KPN reported an operating cash flow of 1.04B EUR which includes an 86M EUR working capital investment. Additionally we should deduct the 86M EUR in lease payments and the 10M EUR coupon on the hybrid securities. This means the underlying operating cash flow was approximately 1.03B EUR, and roughly 970M EUR if you would deduct the taxes that were owed based on the H1 results, but weren’t settled in cash yet and were thus deferred.

KPN Investor Relations

The cash flow statement also shows total capex was approximately 467M EUR spent on tangible assets and 135M EUR on software resulting in a total capex of 602M EUR. This means the underlying free cash flow was 268M EUR or just under 7 cents per share. That’s lower than the net income as the company continues to invest in expanding and improving its network (see later).

Looking at the Q3 update, KPN saw a 1.8% EBITDA increase which jumped to 629M EUR but as the revenue increased by 2.2%, the EBITDA margin actually decreased by a few base points.

KPN Investor Relations

According to the image above, the company generated a positive free cash flow of 198M EUR but there aren’t enough details to check where the free cash flow is coming from and what role the working capital changes played in this. That being said, with a net profit of 636M EUR in the first three quarters of the year, the EPS came in at 0.16 EUR, which means the anticipated full-year dividend of 15 cents per share is already covered by the 9M 2023 earnings.

The capex will remain relatively high in the next few years but will decrease from 2027 on, which should pave the way for a free cash flow acceleration.

While KPN will likely provide more color on its expectations for 2024, the preliminary guidance is definitely very reassuring. As you can see below, the company expects to increase its revenue and EBITDA by about 3% per year and this should result in a free cash flow of 870M EUR, a similar result as the company is expecting in 2023.

KPN Investor Relations

Interestingly, KPN plans to hike the dividend by 2 cents per share to 0.17 EUR which represents a dividend yield of approximately 5.4% based on a share price of 3.15 EUR.

That’s a good start, but I'm equally charmed by KPN’s guidance for the 2024-2027 period. The company expects to continue to grow its revenue and EBITDA by approximately 3% per year but the free cash flow is expected to have a CAGR of 7%. The explanation for this is relatively straightforward: While the company is currently spending 1B EUR per year on capex, the majority of the heavy lifting will be done by 2027 and in that year the capex will drop to just 1B EUR, which is in line with the depreciation rhythm.

Applying the anticipated 7% CAGR for the free cash flow result, the implied free cash flow generation in 2027 is approximately 1.07B EUR which translates into 26.5 cents per share. However, as the company also is planning on spending 1B EUR on buying back stock, the share count will continue to decrease. If I would assume an average share price or 4 EUR per share (30% higher than the current share price), KPN would be able to buy back 6% of its share count which would further increase the free cash flow result to 28 cents per share.

Buying back stock also will support the dividend growth rhythm. KPN expects to increase its dividend by 7% per year as well, which is in line with its anticipated free cash flow increase. This implies a dividend of 20.8 cents per share based on the 2027 results. This represents a payout ratio of 78% based on the anticipated free cash flow result excluding buybacks. Including the impact of buybacks (using the same scenario as outlined above), the payout ratio would decrease to approximately 74%.

Investment thesis

KPN has had its fair share of issues in the past, but management’s transparency level has been excellent. The guidance for 2024 and even 2027 is clear, and management will be held accountable for those targets. And if we are to believe the dividend growth projections, KPN’s current share price represents a forward dividend yield of 6.6% by 2027 while the stock is trading at just 11 times the anticipated free cash flow for that year.

And that makes KPN very attractive. The dividend and free cash flow projections appear to be reasonable and while the capex will remain high in the next few years, the company’s investments should pay off for its shareholders.

PEO Fund: A Buy The Dip Opportunity In This 6% Yield Natural Resources CEF,"peshkov

The Adams Natural Resources Fund (NYSE:PEO) invests across energy and materials sector stocks as an actively managed closed-end fund. The attraction here is a strong record, with PEO outperforming sector benchmarks including several indexed ETFs over the past five years. We also like the compelling 6% yield through a quarterly distribution.

Emerging from a volatile period over the past year, we see room to turn constructive on commodity prices and natural resources. The setup here considers the improved global macro outlook on the demand side with a sense that there is some good value in the sector.

We last covered PEO back in 2022, highlighting a bullish backdrop at the time and the fund's unique positioning with the fund delivering a positive return in the period since. Our update today suggests the more recent weakness offers a new buying opportunity.

Data by YCharts

What is the PEO ETF?

PEO's fund objective starts with the preservation of capital while delivering a reasonable income with the opportunity for capital gain by capitalizing on the long-term demand for energy and materials. Adams Funds is a well-recognized institutional investor with PEO itself among one of the oldest CEFs in the market with a history going back to 1929, an incredible 95 years.

While the investing mandate has a broad focus on ""natural resources"", the strategy primarily invests across U.S. stocks that are constituents of the S&P 500 Energy and S&P 500 Materials sectors.

That being said, there is a clear tilt towards the energy sector which represents about 80% of the current allocation. Within that amount, the exposure extends through the supply chain with energy producers at around 55% of portfolio the joined by downstream names at around 25%. In terms of materials, PEO is positioned in the chemicals industry totaling about 15% of the fund weighting, while metals and basic materials are also included.

Keep in mind that since PEO is not intended to track any particular index, the holdings are likely to change over time according to the portfolio managers' market outlook.

Looking through the current portfolio, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is the largest investment with a 19% weighting, followed by Chevron Corp (CVX) at 12%, and ConocoPhillips (COP) at 8%. Down the list, the materials sector is represented by companies like Linde plc (LIN), Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX), and Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) as some notable examples.

While these are all high-profile large-cap leaders, the takeaway is that the overall fund exposure with the cross-sector allocation is distinct compared to benchmarks like the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) and Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB).

source: Adams Funds

PEO performance

Given the tilt toward energy, it's expected that PEO's performance should be a mix between the sector trends, outperforming XLB when XLE leads higher. Over the past year, PEO is down about -6% which is about a 200 basis point improvement relative to XLE, supported by the relative strength from the materials sector exposure which returned 2%.

If we had complete confidence that a certain natural resources sector would lead higher, or a particular stock would outperform, then PEO may not be necessary. Its advantage comes from that underlying uncertainty with the added benefit of diversification and the presumed ability of the portfolio manager to effectively overweight the most compelling opportunities.

Data by YCharts

We can also bring up that PEO has historically traded at a wide discount to NAV. The current spread at approximately -17% is wider than the average over the last decade and likely reflects what has been poor sentiment towards natural resources.

The potential that the underlying stocks in this strategy put together a sustained rally going forward could lead to some of the discount narrowing as an incremental performance driver.

Data by YCharts

PEO distribution

The other reason to consider PEO over XLE or XLB is its income component. The Adams Natural Resources Fund distributes a regular quarterly payout of $0.10 per share while that is supplemented with a larger year-end distribution to reach a targeted 6% yield. In November 2023, PEO paid out $1.05 per share and $1.35 for the full year.

Notably, the entire dividend is based on the underlying investment income and realized gains supported by the covered by the strong NAV performance over the last several years.

Data by YCharts

What's next for PEO?

We mentioned that 2023 was a challenging period for natural resource stocks, particularly compared to 2022 when various commodities reached record-high prices. The backdrop over the past year has been the headwind of macro uncertainties, coupled with climbing interest rates, and a strong U.S. Dollar.

Fast forward, 2024 has kicked off with improved global growth sentiment with a building consensus that the U.S. has averted a recession and cooling inflationary pressures will open the door for Fed rate cuts.

The first exhibit here is the recent action in WTI crude oil (USO) that has already climbed by more than 10% from its December low and approaching a breakout level above $75bbl.

The latest reports include a surprise U.S. crude inventory draw in early January along with agencies like the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC is forecasting strong growth in global oil demand.

source: FinViz

As it relates to other resources, headlines out of China suggest the government is moving forward with stimulus efforts in support of the economy. This is important as China is a major global commodity consumer and a new wave of growth could also work to keep a bid across the materials sector.

While peak pricing levels from 2022 are likely out of reach for the foreseeable future, we sense that the momentum is shifting with room for the market to trend higher. Ultimately, we believe the underlying companies within the PEO portfolio are well-positioned to benefit from a rebound of commodity prices going forward.

From the fund price chart, we like the setup here with PEO making a series of higher lows while consolidating around the $20.00 share price level. A move back towards $23.00 coupled with the dividend income implies a +20% return potential as part of the bullish case for the fund.

Covering risks, it's clear a deterioration of the macro outlook would drive renewed volatility in the sector. A leg lower in energy and other commodity prices would pressure the earnings potential of companies within the PEO fund as a bearish development.

The case we make is that risks are tilted to the upside and the current level offers an attractive entry point.

Seeking Alpha

Final thoughts

The Adams Natural Resources Fund is a high-quality CEF that performs exactly as intended for diversified exposure to the energy and materials sector. The fund stands out as a compelling alternative to indexed ETFs given its high-yield income and impressive performance history in recent years.

We believe the fund can work for investors in the context of a broader and more diversified exposure to represent a tactical or strategic view of this important market segment. With a bullish outlook for commodity prices, we expect PEO to deliver a positive return in 2024.","['cef', 'sector', 'fund', 'natural', 'resources', 'income', 'buy', 'materials', 'opportunity', 'dip', 'peo', 'energy', 'portfolio', 'yield', 'prices']",Seeking Alpha
SociéTé BIC Stock: Performance Keeps Improving (OTCMKTS:BICEF),"HJBC/iStock Editorial via Getty Images

Investment thesis

I started covering Société BIC (OTCPK:BICEF) (OTCPK:BICEY) in December 2020 as impacts from self-imposed restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus worldwide, as well as operating weakness due to lack of enough product innovation and diversification over the years, caused a 70% share price decline from all-time highs reached in 2015. Furthermore, the global projected decline in smoking rates and the digitalization of school material and office tasks suggested that the trend would continue to be negative as long as the company did not adapt to these changes. I updated the situation in September 2023 as it seemed like the management was finally taking the necessary steps to get back on the growth path, but the share price was still 60% below all-time highs as inflationary pressures were having a significant impact on EBIT margins while recessionary concerns fueled investors' pessimism.

In both articles, I explained the reasons why I believed that the share price decline represented a good opportunity for long-term dividend investors with enough patience to wait for the company's picture to improve, and in this article, I am going to break down the results of Q3 2023 and explain why I do think that these results continue to reflect positive results from the efforts carried out in since 2020 under the Horizon Plan.

Since 2020, the company has expanded its total addressable markets thanks to recent acquisitions and product innovation, and profit margins have continued to improve in recent quarters. Throughout this time, the company has remained highly profitable, which has allowed it to maintain an exceptionally robust and debt-free balance sheet. Therefore, I consider this a good time for any dividend growth investor with a long-term horizon interested in geographically diversifying their portfolio as the share price remains depressed.

A brief overview of the company

Société BIC is a French manufacturer of disposable consumer products focused on stationery supplies, lighters, razor blades, and more recently products for the design of temporary tattoos. The company was founded in 1945 and its market cap currently stands at €2.75 billion, so its size is large but not immense as it fits in the low range of the mid-cap category. Also, the company enjoys a highly diversified global presence as 43% of revenues were generated in North America in 2022, 29% in Europe, 17% in Latin America, 6% in the Middle East and Africa, and 5% in Asia and Oceania.

BIC BodyMark (Eu.bic.com/en-gb/beauty/bodymark)

The company's operations are divided into three main business segments: Blade Excellence, Flame for Life, and Human Expression. Under the Flame for Life segment, which provided 39% of revenues in 2022, the company manufactures lighters for all kinds of use cases. Under the Human Expression segment, which generated 38% of revenues in 2022, it manufactures office and school supplies, creative expression products (including temporary tattoos), and digital stationery including tablets and digital pens, among others. Lastly, under the Blade Excellence segment, which generated 22% of overall sales in 2022, the company manufactures shavers, as well as blades and handles for other brands.

The company is currently investing in the development of higher-value products to ensure steady revenue streams in the long term and achieve improved margins, which include the diversification of the use cases of their lighters beyond tobacco, improved shavers for more sensitive skins, and the company's introduction to the temporary tattoo market.

BIC Share price (Investors.bic.com/en-us/calendar-and-share/stock-market-prices)

Currently, shares are trading at €64.75, which represents a 59.24% decline from all-time highs of €158.84 in August 2015 but a 3.02% increase since the last article I wrote, with which the price of the shares has moved very little after the Q3 2023 results despite them showing significant margin expansion and reflecting ongoing efforts continue contributing to revenue growth.

Revenues remain high and are expected to continue increasing in 2024

The company suffered a steady revenue decline in the 2015-2020 period, with the largest drop experienced in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving a total 27.38% decline compared to 2015. Despite this, everything began to improve with the reopening of the global economy in 2021 with an increase of 12.53% compared to 2020 and another increase of 21.95% in 2022, boosted by price raises and acquisitions. As for 2023, revenues increased by 4.46% year over year in Q1 and by 4.38% year over year in Q2.

Societe BIC TTM Revenues (Seeking Alpha)

Despite this, revenues decreased by 3.41% year over year in Q3 2023, and although this result represents a decrease of 12.21% quarter over quarter, this is mostly attributable to the company's seasonality as Q2 is typically the strongest quarter of every year, so the recent drop must be analyzed through a year over year comparison. In this regard, it's important to note that revenues actually grew by 7.2% year over year if calculated on a constant currency basis, and the management has maintained its expectations of closing 2023 with sales growth in the 5% to 7% range. Furthermore, 2024 is also expected to deliver ~5% revenue growth, which would confirm the break of the negative trend experienced in the 2015-2020 period, although this should not move the needle if it is not accompanied by further EBIT margin improvements. Still, the global temporary tattoo market is expected to grow at a CAGR of ~9% in the 2023-2030 period, which should contribute to long-term growth for the company beyond 2024.

In short, the company reported trailing twelve months' revenues of €2.26 billion in Q3 2023, which is slightly above the €2.24 billion reported in 2015. Still, significant headwinds continue to be a challenge as inflationary pressures are causing a deterioration in the purchasing power of many families around the world, which has pushed them to extend the use of the company's products or even switch to cheaper brands or private labels. Also, these same pressures continue to negatively impact margins, albeit to a lesser extent, at a time marked by strong pricing pressures from other manufacturers.

EBIT margins keep improving and the company is highly profitable

Although trailing twelve months' revenues show that the company recovered lost revenues since 2015, this has not been enough to fully recover profit margins as higher raw material and electricity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange rates, higher OpEx, and marketing efforts to boost BIC EZ Reach sales in Europe continue to negatively impact EBIT margins.

Before 2019, the company used to enjoy EBIT margins that danced around 20%, but these have deteriorated in recent quarters as trailing twelve months' EBIT margins stood at 12.90% in Q3 2023. Still, EBIT margins of 14.6% during the quarter represented a significant improvement from the 11.1% reported in the same quarter of 2022 boosted by manufacturing efficiencies, lower raw material prices, and more favorable forex. In this sense, it seems that EBIT margins continue to improve, which is a very positive sign.

Société BIC EBIT Margins (Financial reports)

This improvement shows how pricing actions and manufacturing efficiency initiatives are progressively offsetting current headwinds, but pricing pressures from competitors in the United States remain a challenge. Currently, the trailing twelve months' EBIT margin stands at 12.90%, which suggests that the company continues to be highly competitive as the sector median is significantly below at 9.84%. Still, investors remain concerned as revenues from its most profitable segment, Flame For Life, only increased by 3.9% year over year in Q3 at constant currencies compared to the overall 7.2% increase, which shows a significant slowdown while its adjusted EBIT margin of 34.1% is significantly higher than that of the rest of segments (7.5% in Human Expression and 18.7% in Blade Excellence). Still, the global pocket lighter is expected to grow at a CAGR of ~3% in the 2023-2032 period, so I would not expect the segment to lose strength in the foreseeable future.

Regarding the current situation, the last quarter shows that the efforts carried out since 2020, as well as the recent relaxation of headwinds experienced in 2022, are having a positive impact on profit margins as the company reported a net income of €59.8 million in Q3 2023 compared to €46.8 million in the same quarter of 2022, and EPS of €1.39 compared to €1.06.

BIC 2018-2022 Net income and EPS (Investors.bic.com/en-us/strategy-and-governance/key-figures)

In this regard, the company is highly profitable and profit margins continue to improve. In addition, it has a very robust balance sheet that should allow it to continue navigating the current headwinds while continuing with the Horizon Plan, which is expected to bring new products in 2024 and 2025 and, possibly, new acquisitions to continue increasing the total addressable market.

The balance sheet is very strong as the company is debt-free

The company enjoys a debt-free balance sheet and held €308.3 million in its net cash position at the end of Q3 2023, which represented a €51.6 million decline year-to-date. Still, this decline is mostly attributable to aggressive share buybacks of €97.3 million during the same period, negative changes in working capital and others of €147.8 million, and higher CAPEX of €69 million (compared to €57.4 million in the same period of 2022). Additionally, it must be taken into account that annual dividends paid of €110.2 million took place within these first 9 months, and Q4 won't be affected by it as no dividends are paid in Q4.

BIC YTD Cash position (Q3 2023 Results presentation)

This shows the company's high profitability and suggests that cash from operations should be more robust in the coming quarters due to increased working capital, so the annual dividend of €2.56 per share is, in my opinion, highly safe and even gives the management some margin to continue increasing it in the coming years.

The dividend is safe

After increasing by 1.47% in 2016 to €3.45 per share, the proposed annual dividend remained frozen in 2017 and 2018 until the management decided to cut it by 28.98% in 2019 and by a further 26.53% in 2020 to preserve as much cash as possible amidst the deterioration of cash from operations. Since then, the dividend has increased by 19.44% in 2021 and by a further 19.07% in 2022 to €2.56.

Societe BIC Dividends per share (Investors.bic.com/en-us/strategy-and-governance/key-figures)

This dividend is still 25.80% lower compared to the €3.45 proposed in 2016, 2017, and 2018, while the current dividend yield is 3.95% due to the share price decline experienced in recent years. Furthermore, the dividend yield on cost would stand at 5.33% if the company restored the 2018 dividend in full. In this sense, the dividend has a lot of upside potential in the coming years as the cash payout ratio has historically been low as you can see in the table below.

Year 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Cash from operations (in millions) €349.0 €367.1 €298.7 €380.6 €303.9 €317.2 €357.6 €280.6 €300.0 Dividends paid (in millions) €122.4 €134.8 €277.0 €161.0 €157.8 €155.2 €110.2 €80.9 €94.7 Cash payout ratio 35.07% 36.72% 92.74% 42.30% 51.92% 48.93% 30.82% 28.83% 31.57% Click to enlarge

In this regard, a negative change of -€51.6 million in the net cash position in the first 9 months of 2023 reflects that the company is still capable of comfortably covering its dividend considering unusually high share buybacks of €97.3 million and a negative impact of €147.8 million due to changes in working capital and others, pending the Q4 results in which no dividend will be paid. Furthermore, the non-existence of debt means that no interest expenses need to be covered at the end of each period, which offers a significant competitive advantage to the company and significant safety to investors.

Share buybacks remain in force

The company has a long tradition of buying back shares as a way to reward long-term investors as the total number of shares outstanding decreased by 13.72% from Q3 2013 to Q3 2023. This means that each share represents a growing portion of the company as the results are distributed among fewer shares, which progressively improves per-share metrics.

BIC Share Buybacks (Investors.bic.com/en-us/strategy-and-governance/key-figures)

Furthermore, the company already repurchased €97.3 million worth of shares in 2023 still pending Q4 results, which means that share buybacks are still in force. For this reason, investors could expect their position to slowly grow (in terms of the size of the company that each share represents) over the years, which should positively contribute to their total return in the long term. Also, fewer outstanding shares should make way for future dividend raises as the dividend is distributed among fewer and fewer shares as time passes.

Risks worth mentioning

In the long term, I consider BIC's risk profile to be quite low because, after all, it is a highly profitable company with a long tradition of manufacturing essential products that enjoys a very robust balance sheet and no debt. Despite that, there are certain risks that I would like to highlight.

Recent interest rate hikes could trigger a global recession, which could have a direct impact on the company's operations as consumers could extend the use of BIC's products before replacing them to save money or even move to cheaper brands.

The global pocket lighter market is expected to show very moderate growth in the coming years, which means the company must provide added value to its products from other business segments to achieve and maintain the profitability enjoyed during the years before the coronavirus pandemic. In this regard, the challenges are not few and the company could report lower EBIT margins compared to the past for a very long time if it loses market share in the lighter industry.

Profit margins could contract again if inflationary pressures intensify again, and this could also have a further impact on consumers' purchasing power.

The dividend could grow at lower rates from now on. It is important to remember that the dividend growth experienced in 2021 and 2022 came, in part, because the company cautiously cut the dividend in 2019 and 2020 due to operating weaknesses and the coronavirus pandemic, so it could be expected that dividend growth will moderate as it approaches the €3.45 proposed in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Still, the dividend yield on cost of €3.45 per share would be 5.33% at the current share price, so the dividend upside potential is high.

The pace of share buybacks could be slowed if EBIT margins and sales do not continue to improve or if new headwinds are added to the current context as the management could decide to preserve cash to navigate temporary headwinds.

Conclusion

When the results of the third quarter of 2023 were published, 2.5 years had passed since the Horizon plan was launched, and there are still 2.5 more years left until its completion. Since then, operations have improved significantly and sales have surpassed (albeit barely) 2015 levels, breaking the negative trend of recent years. The third quarter of 2023 is no exception as revenues remained robust, and EBIT margins have continued to expand. Furthermore, the company continues to enjoy an exceptionally strong balance sheet as the dividend is fully covered with relative ease.

The fact that the slowdown in sales growth is more notable in the most profitable segment continues to worry investors, and the share price remains 59% below the all-time high as a consequence as it could take many years until margins fully recover. But despite this pessimism, I believe that long-term dividend growth investors interested in providing some geographic diversification to their portfolio could take advantage of the low share prices as the long-term dividend yield on cost potential is high. In fact, the current 3.95% yield is already quite generous, in my opinion, not only because of the upside potential but also because the cash payout ratio has been historically low.

AGNC Investment Stock: Cycle Has Shifted (NASDAQ:AGNC),"coldsnowstorm

I upgraded AGNC Investment (NASDAQ:AGNC) back in June, saying that with the Fed tightening cycle likely coming to an end now was the time to start accumulating shares. Including dividends, the stock has generated an over 5% return since then. Let's catch up on the name after its recent earnings report.

Company Profile

As a refresher, AGNC is mortgage REIT that primarily derives its income from the spread between the interest it earns on the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) it holds and its borrowing costs. The firm will also use leverage to increase its return.

It primarily invests in MBS backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae, which come with essentially no credit risk, as these agencies backstop the mortgages. Non-agency residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), and credit risk transfer (CRT) securities represent a small portion of its portfolio.

At the end of Q3 2023, AGNC's investment portfolio was valued at $60.2 billion, with $58.3 billion of that in Agency MBS and $5.4 billion in TBA (to be announced) securities. Nearly 94% of its portfolio was in 30-year fixed rate MBS and TBA securities at quarter end.

The Turn Begins

The main story throughout much of 2022 and 2023 for AGNC and other mortgage REITs was the continued pressure on tangible book value (""TBV""). This was caused by a combination of increasing interest rates, as well as the spread between Treasuries and MBS increasing. As new MBS are issued at high coupons, this causes the older MBS in a mortgage REITs' portfolios to be repriced lower in order for the yields to be similar to that of current issued MBS.

Company Presentation

As a result of this pressure, AGNC saw its TBV go from $15.75 at the start of 2022 down to $8.08 at the end of Q3 2023. That was a massive -49% drop. Given that mortgage REITs generally trade at a multiple to their TBV, it is no surprise that the AGNC's stock has had a difficult two years.

With the Fed signaling in December that it will shift policy and look to cut interest rates three times in 2024, however, the rates for mortgages began to decline. As a result, AGNC saw its TBV increase nearly 8% sequentially to $8.70 from $8.08.

Notably, AGNC issued $376 million in common stock during the quarter through its ATM program. While issuing stock is dilutive and generally viewed as a negative for most industries, when a mortgage REIT issues equity above book value it actually helps increase its book value. AGNC was able to issue the shares when its stock was trading well above TBV per share.

Meanwhile, AGNC was able to continue to get solid spreads in Q4. It had a 3.08% average net interest spread in the quarter. That compares to 3.06% a year ago and 3.03% in Q3. Two years ago its average net interest spread was 2.74%. So on that front, AGNC has been doing a great job, highlighted by its hedging, which has been able to keep its funding costs down. This is one area where AGNC continues to shine.

Overall, AGNC generated 60 cents per share in net spread and dollar roll income. It generated a 12.1% economic return of its tangible common equity, with its TBV rising 62 cents per share and it paying out 36 cents in dividends during the quarter.

AGNC ended the quarter with 7.0x tangible net book value ""at risk"" leverage. That compares to 7.4x at the end of 2022 and 7.9x at the end of Q3.

Not surprisingly, AGNC management was much more bullish on its Q4 earrings call than it has been over the past couple of year. On its call, CEO Peter Federico said:

""As we begin 2024, we believe the investment outlook for Agency MBS is decidedly more favorable than the previous 2 years. This positive outlook is supported by historically attractive valuation levels on both an absolute and relative basis. Low mortgage origination volumes, declining interest rate volatility, a less inverted yield curve and most importantly, a more investor-friendly monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve. Our favorable outlook for Agency MBS is further supported by several important developments. First, in the fourth quarter, the Fed adopted a more neutral monetary policy stance as inflation measures continue to show progress toward the Fed's long-run target. More significantly, at the December meeting, the Fed also indicated that multiple rate cuts were possible in 2024, assuming inflation measures continue to improve as expected. Second, interest rate volatility is poised to decline. Over the last 2 years, the distribution of potential interest rate path has been exceedingly wide, due to the many uncertainties associated with inflation, the economy, regional banks, fiscal policy, geopolitical events and of course, the Fed's unprecedented dual-track approach to monetary policy tightening. Not surprisingly, these major uncertainties led to a meaningful increase in interest rate volatility.""

Overall, AGNC put up one of its best quarters in the past two years. The firm has done a great job expanding it net income spread, and it finally saw a nice reversal in TBV. The former is fueled by AGNC management, which has been masters at hedging. In the quarter, the company's Treasury-based hedges outperformed traditional swap-based hedges, helping its strong performance.

Valuation

For mortgage REITs, I usually look at a price to book as the best way to value them. On that front, AGNC trades at 1.12x.

AGNC was the first MREIT to report its Q4 results, so I don't have end of year values for the other firms. Based on Q3 book value, though, Annaly (NLY) trades at 1.07x book while ARMOUR (ARR) is at 0.90x. Two Harbors (TWO) trades 0.87x.

AGNC trades at a premium to other MREITs, but this has been well earned given its hedging prowess and overall management over the years. I'd also note that trading above book does have some advantages, as discussed above, as it allows firms to issue shares to buy more MBS and it increases book value at the same time.

Where TBV ends up will depend on interest rates, leverage, and where Treasury-to-MBS spreads head, but I don't think $11 is out of the question given the expected three cuts. Place a 1.1x multiple on that, and you have a $12 stock.

Conclusion

The tide has turned for agency-backed mortgage REITs, and now is the time to get into AGNC if you haven't already. The current interest rate cycle has peaked, and a Fed rate-cutting campaign will drive rates lower and TBV higher. At the same time, expect spreads to Treasuries to also narrow, which should help TBV as well.

The combination of a nearly 15% yield together with rising TBV, should be a driver for AGNC in the coming year. AGNC is not a buy and hold forever stock, but this is the cycle you want to own it in. I rate the stock a ""Buy"" with a $12 target.","['agnc', 'shifted', 'tbv', 'investment', 'book', 'rate', 'mbs', 'nasdaqagnc', 'stock', 'interest', 'mortgage', 'spread', 'cycle', 'value']",Seeking Alpha
T-Rex 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF (TSLT): Risky Bet On Tesla Shares,"shaunl

It never ceases to amaze me what passes for innovation on Wall Street. One good example is leveraged ETFs. In the 2000s, leveraged ETFs were first introduced and applied to broad indices, like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq100 Index. Then, as if broad indices did not provide enough risk for investors, fund manufacturers started issuing 'innovative' levered ETFs like the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bull 3X Shares ETF (LABU) that provide daily levered returns on narrow sectors like biotech stocks.

In recent months, we have seen even more extreme behaviour with the issuance of single-stock levered ETFs like the T-REX 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF (NASDAQ:TSLT).

The TSLT ETF provides daily 2x levered exposure to shares of Tesla shares. Like all levered ETFs, the TSLT suffers from volatility over time. Furthermore, near-term prospects for Tesla shares are poor, as the company downgraded its growth prospects for 2024. I rate the TSLT ETF a sell.

Fund Overview

The T-REX 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF seeks to provide daily returns that are twice the return of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) stock. The fund achieves this levered return by holding cash plus total return swaps struck with large investment banks that are reset nightly to maintain 200% exposure to net assets (Figure 1).

Figure 1 - TSLT holdings (rexshares.com)

Investors considering the TSLT ETF should read these warnings from FINRA and the SEC.

Levered ETFs Only Designed To Work On Short Time Horizons

As a reminder, levered ETFs only provide their desired exposure on short time horizons. When investors start looking beyond the 1-day horizon, volatility and convexity will start to introduce tracking error.

For example, if we started off with $100 invested in TSLT, if TSLA returns 5% on day 1, the position will grow to $110 (2 times 5% return). If TSLA returns 5% again on day 2, the holding will grow to $121.00, more than twice the theoretical 2-day compounded return of 10.25% or $120.50.

Conversely, if the index returns were consecutive -5%, then the initial investment will end up at $81.00, versus twice the 2-day compounded loss of 9.75% or $80.50. This effect is 'positive convexity'. In layman terms, investors' exposure grows as the bet is winning, but shrinks as the bet is losing.

Finally, if the returns on TSLA stock is +5% followed by -5%, investors end up with $99.00, less than twice the 2-day compounded loss of 0.25% or $99.50. This effect is called 'volatility decay'.

While on a day-to-day basis, the impacts of positive convexity and volatility decay are small, if we compound them over many days, they can cause significant deviation in realized vs. expected performance.

For example, since inception in October, the TSLT ETF has lost 14.6% in value while TSLA's stock has only declined by 4.0%, so TSLT has underperformed its theoretical 2X return by over 6% in 3 months (Figure 2).

Figure 2 - TSLT vs. TSLA (Seeking Alpha)

Is TSLT Designed To Underperform?

In fact, according to modeling done by RexShares, when volatility is high, the TSLT ETF is expected to underperform its theoretical returns. For example, if TSLA's annualized volatility is 100%, the TSLT ETF would be expected to lose 63.2% of its value, even if the cumulative return for the year was 0% for TSLA shares (Figure 3).

Figure 3 - Estimated fund returns for TSLT depending on TSLA returns and volatility (TSLT prospectus)

Given that Tesla is one of the most volatile large-cap stocks in the market with historical 90-day realized volatility ranging from 40% to 75% in the past year, the TSLT ETF is almost designed to underperform (Figure 4).

Figure 4 - TSLA has high realized volatility (alphaquery.com)

What Is The Appeal Of TSLT?

With such a large slippage 'tax', what exactly is the appeal of single-stock ETFs like TSLT?

The way I look at it, the appeal of leveraged single-stock ETFs are as 'swing trading' instruments for nimble investors, who may not be satisfied with the returns from just trading the shares directly. Due to the positive convexity of the ETF, if the underlying stock goes through a multi-day stretch of strong returns, holders of the TSLT ETF can experience extraordinary returns.

For example, if we look at Figure 2 above and isolate the time period from October 30th to December 27th, assuming investors had perfect timing and bought at the absolute swing lows and sold at the absolute swing highs, the TSLT ETF could have netted investors 67.2% instead of 32.5% returns from the underlying stock (Figure 5).

Figure 5 - TSLT magnifies returns (Seeking Alpha)

In fact, if TSLA's stock goes on another epic run like it did in 2020, when TSLA shares went up 743%, the TSLT ETF may go up several thousand percent due to positive convexity (Figure 6).

Figure 6 - Theoretical 2x TSLA returns (Author created with data from Yahoo Finance)

Fundamental Outlook For Tesla Is Poor

However, before investors start counting their chickens before they hatch, investors need to consider how likely Tesla's stock will rally 700% from the current level.

After today's large selloff, Tesla is currently the 11th largest publicly traded company in the world with a $580 billion market cap (Figure 7). For Tesla to go 7x, it will have to become the most valuable company in the world. While not impossible, this move is highly unlikely.

Figure 7 - TSLA is 11th largest company in the world (companiesmarketcap.com)

In fact, with a poor Q4/23 earnings report and a cloudy outlook for 2024, I believe the outlook is poor for Tesla's shares. Despite the stock selloff, Tesla's shares are still outrageously valued at over 81x Fwd P/E and 32x Fwd EV/EBITDA (Figure 8).

Figure 8 - TSLA is extremely overvalued (Seeking Alpha)

Tesla's prospects are unlikely to improve until 2025, when its 'next generation' vehicles are expected to be delivered (author's note, there are scant details on these 'next gen' models, not even mock-ups).

Conclusion

Investment products are increasingly becoming speculative, as investors clamour for 'leverage' and short-term gains. The TSLT ETF gives investors exposure to 2x the daily returns of TSLA's shares.

While nimble investors may be able to derive extraordinary gains from speculating in TSLT if they have perfect timing, these products are also exceeding risky. If timed incorrectly, an investment in TSLT can lead to some eye-watering drawdowns. Levered ETFs also suffer from volatility slippage over time.

In the near-term, I would advise against buying the TSLT ETF, as Tesla's shares appear to be extremely overvalued relative to the company's poor near-term prospects.

I rate the TSLT ETF a sell.","['bet', 'risky', 'figure', 'tsla', 'shares', 'etf', 'target', 'tesla', 'trex', 'daily', 'investors', 'returns', 'long', 'etfs', 'tslt', 'volatility']",Seeking Alpha
Knight-Swift Stock Q4: Risk Reward Situation Still Not Favorable (NYSE:KNX),"andresr

Overview

My recommendation for Knight-Swift (NYSE:KNX) is a hold rating, as I am not a fan of the risk/reward situation given that KNX is already trading at 20x forward earnings. Operating performance was not favorable as well, with trucking continuing to decline and intermodal facing pressure (and still not profitable). While management existing in the insurance business was a good choice, I don’t think it is enough to turn the sentiment around. Note that I previously rated a hold rating for KNX as 3Q23 results were weak, reflecting the challenges that KNX was facing in the transportation sector. Profitability was also not trending in the right direction.

Recent results & updates

KNX reported 4Q23 reports yesterday. Total revenue saw a 2% decline to $1.931 billion, coupled with an adjusted operating ratio [OR] of 93%, and EBIT saw $118.5 million. Consequently, KNX reported adj. operating EPS of $0.39 versus $0.43 consensus estimates.

I believe 4Q23 results were quite mixed, with the outlook remaining uncertain despite some positives. The uncertain outlook is well reflected in management's forward-looking guidance. Specifically, they refrained from providing guidance for FY24 due to factors such as an uncertain bid season, weather disruptions in January, and the timing of the inflection, which made it difficult to forecast into 2H24. Instead, they guided for 1H24, expecting an EPS range of $0.37 to $0.41 for 1Q24 and $0.53 to $0.57 for 2Q24. Looking more closely at the 4Q23 performance, we can still see headwinds present. For instance, while trucking revenue grew by 25%, USX acquisitions were the main reason. After adjusting for the acquisition, the trucking core business's revenue fell by 12.5%, showing that the difficult operating environment is still not over. KNX continues to experience a weak pricing environment, especially in the premium pricing tier, and project volume. The most recent demand trend in December was also not positive, as management noted a drop in demand in December.

Loose capacity prevented any premium pricing opportunities as well. Revenue per mile was up 1.4% sequentially, reflecting stability in the existing businesses, while US Xpress saw positive progress as we continue working on the business mix. There were a few seasonal projects for truckload and the projects that did exist were smaller in scale than what we see in a typical peak season. Loose capacity prevented any premium pricing opportunities as well. from: 4Q2023 earnings call

Aside from trucking, intermodal also continues to see pressure with no signs of recovery. Revenues fell 16%, driven by a 19.7% decrease in revenue per load. Qualitatively, the weakness was driven by customers choosing to convert to trucks due to better pricing and transit times, which was compounded as a headwind as it negatively impacted revenue per load. What was worse than this performance was that this segment remained unprofitable.

The only major positive that I took away from the quarter was that management finally let go of its insurance business. This segment has been a drag on both revenue and profit performance. In the quarter, revenue declined by 47% and remained loss-making, generating $71.7 million in EBIT losses. The timeline to complete the existing policy is 1Q24, and KNX has already begun canceling policies. Although this will not have a meaningful impact on 2024 performance, it was good to know that resources are not being freed up to address other parts of the business.

One important catalyst to track ahead that I expect will have a major impact on stock price sentiment is the contract negotiation with labor unions. With inflation still above the Fed's long-term target level of 2% and the upward pressure on wages still present in the economy, I believe the unions will not let go of this opportunity to negotiate aggressively against the trucking industry, making 2024 margin performance uncertain.

Valuation and risk

Author's valuation model

According to my model, the risk-reward situation remains unattractive. Because of the weak operating performance seen so far, compounded by the uncertain outlook for the intermodal segment and margin performance (due to the labor union negotiation), I have revised my estimates downward, matching consensus estimates for FY24 (13% revenue growth and 5% net margins). Historically, consensus has been fairly accurate in their earnings estimates (more than often underestimating). The KNX valuation is the one that is puzzling. Given the performance, I do not believe it should be trading at 20x forward earnings. Note that KNX used to trade between 11 and 18x forward earnings, and every time he went above the top-end range, valuation came back down in quick fashion and large magnitude. I expect the same pattern to repeat again, driving valuation down to its historical average (through-cycle) earnings of 15x. Playing devil’s advocate, even if the valuation stays at 20x, the reward is still not attractive at all.

Author's valuation model

Summary

I maintain my hold rating on KNX due to an unfavorable risk-reward situation. The recently reported 4Q23 results reflected mixed performance, with total revenue declining 2%, an adjusted operating ratio of 93%, and adjusted operating EPS of $0.39. Despite the positive decision to divest the insurance business, KNX faces ongoing challenges in its core trucking and intermodal segments, with weak pricing environments and unprofitable intermodal operations. The uncertain outlook, marked by the absence of FY24 guidance and labor union negotiations, adds to the cautious stance.","['reward', 'situation', 'operating', 'earnings', 'intermodal', 'performance', 'pricing', 'favorable', 'risk', 'knightswift', 'stock', 'knx', 'valuation', 'trucking', 'uncertain', 'nyseknx', 'revenue', 'q4']",Seeking Alpha
KRE ETF: I Don't Love The Regional Banking Story (NYSEARCA:KRE),"SrdjanPav/E+ via Getty Images

Main Thesis & Background

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSEARCA:KRE) as an investment option at its current market price. This is a fund with an objective to ""provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Regional Banks Select Industry Index"".

I regularly review the banking sector as a whole, with a focus mostly on large-cap banks. But regional banks are also on my radar, especially given the volatile year they had in 2023, as well as the fact that this is a sector that historically offers an above-average yield. Nevertheless, I have been cautious on this theme for a while, including when I reviewed it last year. I saw limited potential for KRE and have been proven right in the interim:

Fund Performance (KRE) (Seeking Alpha)

Clearly, KRE has been a weak spot. Even with its run-up since late last year, this fund is dramatically under-performing the broader market. At first glance this could look like a buying opportunity - and I would understand that sentiment. However, I see a number of different headwinds that make me reluctant to put down my hard earned cash with this equity play. I will explain each in detail below.

The Commercial Real Estate Headwind

One of the primary reasons for my caution on this sector has to do with the difficulties facing the commercial real estate sector. With job cuts, hybrid (and fully remote) work, as well as a flight out of urban areas, commercial real estate has seen a difficult environment over the past few years. I see that continuing, and it is pressuring regional banks in a big way.

But, wait - you say - this is an article about regional banks, not commercial real estate. So what gives?

The answer is that regional banks hold a big percentage of the total amount of the $1.7 trillion in commercial real estate debt held by US banks as a whole that is coming due in each calendar year this decade:

Commercial Real Estate Debt (Bloomberg)

This means that the margins and profits of US banks large and small are impacted by the performance of these loans. Throughout 2023, this has not been a good thing, as regional banks like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republican bank failed.

Looking ahead, this is a headwind that is impacted by multiple factors. One, as interest rates rise, this is pressuring the property values over commercial buildings, as well as other real estate assets. For office space in particular, vacancy rates have risen substantially. This means that values are dropping for two reasons - higher cap rates and also the fact that demand is down. This is not unique to commercial real estate by any means, as regional malls and retail space is also seeing an uptick in vacancy rates. But the acceleration of the office space vacancy rate in the near term is my big concern:

Delinquency Rates by Sector (JPMorgan Chase)

This is raising solvency risks for potentially hundreds of US banks, but as mentioned above, it has a disproportionate impact on smaller (regional ones). This is critical to understand because I am not a ""bear"" on the Financials sector in total. But for me if I want banking sector exposure, I will focus on the large-cap names rather than the regionals. Part of this determination was made because smaller banks are more exposed (as a percentage of total assets) to the woes of the commercial real estate sector than their large-cap peers:

CRE Exposure (By Bank) (Federal Reserve)

As you can see, with the exception of Wells Fargo (WFC), the largest banks have minimal exposure to this sector. Meanwhile, the regionals (at the far right of the chart) have substantial exposure here. I believe this is a major problem in 2024 because I see these challenges remaining top of mind and probably getting worse, not better. Even if interest rates decline they will be elevated for the first half of the year and office delinquencies are not going to suddenly reverse. In fact, if we see a recession, those rates are only going to get worse. This will stifle lending at regional banks and cause them to have to write-down the assets on their books. None of this is an investable scenario in my view.

Banks Are Preparing For Losses

While the last paragraph is quite bearish, I will take this moment to pause. This is not meant to be an apocalyptic review, and I don't want to give that impression. There are positives to the banking sector - large and small alike. While I see headwinds that make the sector un-investable for me, I would be doing a disservice if I didn't present the facts in a rational way.

To start with, I want to illustrate that while declining real estate values are a major pain point, they are unlikely to cause more widespread panic. I see Silicon Valley and First Republic as exceptions, not the rule, and believe even smaller, regional lenders are prepared to handle some volatility in this space. The reason for this belief is that the banking sector has ramped up loan loss provisions aggressively in 2023 (on the backdrop of those bank failures). What this looks like in practice is that while charge-offs (losses) are on the rise, banks are capitalized well enough to absorb these losses:

Reserves & Net Charge-Offs (US Banks in Aggregate) (FDIC)

What this illustrates to me is that while losses are rising, banks have been anticipating this and should be able to handle it relatively smoothly. That is central to why I am not an outright bear on this sector - or the individual companies that underlie KRE's portfolio.

However, just being able to ""absorb"" losses is not a real enticing investment case. I am differentiating from the fact that these companies can manage this environment against being a fundamentally strong buy argument. Will regional banks go bust because of commercial real estate loans? Based on their preparedness, it doesn't seem likely. But not going bust isn't how we find ""alpha"" - we find it some compelling growth stories. I don't see that being the case here, so I want to manage expectations on how good this metric really is.

Priced For Trouble

Expanding on the prior paragraph, I recognize the challenges facing regional banks are not exactly unknown. They garnered quite a bit of press last year due to some failures and have remained top-of-mind in many investment discussions and forums. So while I am using this space to reiterate my concerns, I am certainly not the only one!

I bring this up because KRE is priced quite cheaply. Looking at the current P/B and P/E ratios, I see a fund that has some bad news baked in:

Current Valuation Metrics (KRE) (State Street)

This is clearly much cheaper than the broader market (as measured by the S&P 500) and should limit some downside if market or sector volatility picks up going forward. While I think this cheapness is warranted to a degree and I don't see this as a ""value opportunity"", I would emphasize this is not an expensive sector to own. For a contrarian thinker who is more optimistic than me on the opportunity for regional banks in 2024, this valuation metric could be enticing. In my view, I don't want to get sucked into buying struggling companies just because they appear cheap, but that is a subjective argument. Others may draw a different conclusion and it is important to give this metric some consideration.

Banks Now Want Lower Rates?

Another important headwind from 2023 that continues to this day is the fact that regional banks have seen their deposit costs rise as a result of higher benchmark rates from the Fed. While initially higher interest rates were seen as a good thing - and they were - some of that effect is wearing off with year-over-year comparisons getting difficult to beat.

What I mean is, as rates stayed high, regional banks were forced to increase what they paid in interest to draw in deposits. While large-cap banks kept deposit rates quite low, regional banks have to compete more aggressively for customers. But, simultaneously, the levels they were able to charge for loans hit a ceiling. The regional failures discussed earlier accelerated this upward deposit re-pricing activity as smaller institutions had to convince customers their deposits were safe - and pay them more to convince them!

The net result of this is that now regional banks are actually hoping for the Fed to cut rates so they can begin to pay less to hold deposits. This is a far cry from the days when investors (and bank executives) were looking forward to higher rates because net margins would improve. While that initially did happen, margins have plateaued as I mentioned:

Net Income and Margin for US Banks (Aggregate) (Goldman Sachs)

This is why earnings reports haven't excited investors. There has been an acceleration in costs related to layoffs, FDIC insurance, and deposits, but at the same time margins are stagnating due to credit losses and loan-interest ceilings. Similar to the credit loss provision metric I mentioned previously in this review, this is not an investment story that I can get behind.

And this is not just my opinion. During M&T Bank's (MTB) fourth quarter earning's call last week, CFO Darryl Bible was quoted:

Its CFO, Daryl Bible, told analysts that lower rates would help its commercial lending and investment banking businesses.

I get kind of excited, if the Fed just lowers rates just a little bit""

Source: M&T Bank Earnings Conference Call

My conclusion from all this is one that lacks confidence. We heard for years about how banks would perform well and generate alpha as soon as rates went up. Now, with an elevated rate environment, banks are under-performing the S&P 500 and the message from executives is that things will improve once rates go down. It is contradictory at best, and leaves me searching for a better sector to put my investment dollars to work.

Bottom-line

Regional banks, and KRE by extension, are up strongly from late October lows. The market has begun to price in rate cuts this year on the tide of declining inflation and resilient economic growth. Some analysts believe this will disproportionately benefit regional banks, but I have my doubts.

The sector is plagued by poor performing commercial real estate assets, recent bank failures, and expensive deposits. For this sector, I prefer the large-cap names that pay less for cash deposits, have less office space exposure, and actually benefited from the recent bank collapses as they grew their customer base after the fallout. As a result, I am maintaining my cautious outlook on KRE, and urge my followers to consider any positions in this fund very carefully as we navigate 2024.","['dont', 'sector', 'bank', 'estate', 'regional', 'kre', 'love', 'investment', 'rates', 'real', 'nysearcakre', 'commercial', 'banking', 'etf', 'banks']",Seeking Alpha

The Problem of Recency Bias

The S&P 500 Index recently hit an all-time high. Unfortunately, few realize that when we adjust for the money supply, stocks remain at levels they reached back in 1996. $1 in 1996 is equal to $2.00 in 2024, so investors need double what they had in 1996 to have the same standard of living. This is profound when you look at this chart.

Inflationchart.com

This makes today's extreme overvaluation as I discussed in my last piece, The Age of Overvaluation, all the more concerning. It is important to keep the current valuation as measured by the CAPE ratio, in mind when making decisions of how to allocate capital over long periods of time.

The 50-year average of the Shiller P/E (CAPE Ratio) is 21.8, currently we are sitting at 32.57. It is clear that U.S. Stocks at the current CAPE ratio are poor investments for long term investors, yet that is exactly where investors are putting their capital.

Across social media, on financial news, and even in real conversations, I have heard more and more about a desire to restrict investing to US markets only. To paraphrase a noted financial analyst on CNBC, international destinations are great for vacationing but not for investing. Even professionals can fall for recency bias. It is a blind spot of human behavior.

As investors look at the outstanding returns they had, earning a cumulative return of over 597.15%, or 11.18% a year in the 2009-2023 period, adjusted for inflation, and including dividends. That is an incredible run for U.S. Stocks. Over the same period, international stocks have gone nowhere.

The chart below depicts the performance from 2009-2023 of five funds which track five indexes in the US and International markets.

It is no wonder why investors want to focus entirely on U.S. stocks, but this is recency bias in action. Recency bias is the notion that what has done well in the recent past will continue to do well in the future. Investors saw this in the late 1990's stock craze, piling into tech stocks at ultra-high valuations expecting the party to go on forever. Unfortunately, the exuberance gave way to reality and the market fell over 80% leading to a lost decade for U.S. Stocks. Another problem of recency bias is forgetting about the periods when foreign stocks outperformed the U.S. While investors think this never happens it actually happens more than they think.

Tweedy Browne & Co.

In the observed return periods from 1969-2023 (526, rolling 10-year measurement periods) US Stocks as measured by the S&P 500 index beat international stocks as measured by the MSCI EAFE index 294 times or 56% of the observed periods. Investors forget that the tables were turned not that long ago with international stocks beating the U.S. market significantly, and emerging markets besting the U.S. by close to 3x.

Buckingham Strategic Wealth

This is what recency bias looks like; taking the recent returns and allocating your money based on those results. This is no way to invest, it is reactionary, rather than taking a thoughtful planning approach to your financial future.

I have always advocated investors taking a big picture, long term approach to investing. Designing a portfolio of uncorrelated assets that meet your long-term goals and holding them through thick and thin.

This is why it is important for investors to maintain an allocation to international equities as part of that plan, so let's examine the case for why international investing is so important.

The Evidence for International Investing

Investors should reconsider their decision to invest in US markets to the exclusion of international equities. International stocks provide better valuations and in the case of emerging markets, higher growth rates in their economies. Investing in particularly small cap stocks in these markets, may provide investors with an opportunity to capture this rapid growth. Reviewing the literature on international investing and how U.S. investors can best benefit from adding overseas stocks, we turn to the research.

1. Global Equity Investing: The Benefits of Diversification and Sizing Your Allocation by Vanguard authors Brian Scott, Kimberly Stockton and Scott Donaldson. They state:

""The rationale for diversification is clear-domestic equities tend to be more exposed to the narrower economic and market forces of their home market while stocks outside an investor's home market tend to offer exposure to a wider array of economic and market forces.""

Despite their findings, a previous Vanguard study showed a clear home country bias in investors' portfolios.

Vanguard

2. What Causes Home Asset Bias and How Should it Be Measured? by Debra Glassman and Leigh Riddick found that U.S. investors tend to under allocate to international stocks because of a perception that international stocks carry more risk, but this perception is overstated by a factor of 1.5 to 3.5 their historical value.

3. Investor Diversification and International Equity Markets, by Ken French and James Poterba. They found that the perception of return will depend on the market you are in. For example, a U.S. investor was more likely to see forward returns for their home market to be higher than say, a UK investors perception of forward returns for the U.S market.

In this paper, we construct new estimates of the international equity portfolio holdings of investors in the U.S., Japan, and Britain. More than 98% of the equity portfolio of Japanese investors is held domestically; the analogous percentages are 94% for the U.S., and 82% for Britain. We use a simple model of investor preferences and behavior to show that current portfolio patterns imply that investors in each nation expect returns in their domestic equity market to be several hundred basis points higher than returns in other markets. This lack of diversification appears to be the result of investor choices, rather than institutional constraints.

4. International Diversification Works (Eventually) by Clifford Asness, Roni Israelov and John Liew.

Common, short-term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction. We show that over the long term, markets do not tend to crash at the same time. This finding is no surprise because even though market panics can be important drivers of short-term returns, country-specific economic performance dominates over the long term...Diversification protects investors against the adverse effects of holding concentrated positions in countries with poor long-term economic performance. Over longer horizons, underlying economic growth matters more than short-lived panics with respect to returns, and international diversification does an excellent job of protecting investors.""

5. ""Mononationals: The Diversification Benefits of Investing in Companies with No Foreign Sales,"" by Cormac Mullen and Jenny Berrill

The authors make the argument that owning multinational companies overseas provides no real diversification benefit. Instead they argue for investing in ""mononationals"" that capture the growth in the local economies they operate in. Concluding:

""We suggest that a portfolio of international stocks classified solely as domestic offers the potential for more international diversification benefits than a portfolio of more-internationalized stocks.""

6. ""Where Are the Gains from International Diversification?"" by Rex Sinquefield. The author found that international small cap and value stocks provide the best diversification benefits.

Larry Swedroe did an analysis looking at the correlations between various global markets. He found that:

When designing a portfolio, all else equal, we would prefer to add asset classes that have lower correlations. With that in mind, to see which international asset classes provide the greatest diversification benefits, we'll look at the correlation data for both large and small stocks. The table below shows the annual correlations for the last 20 calendar years, January 1999-December 2018.

Buckingham Strategic Wealth

As you can see, the benefits of international diversification are greater when investing in small stocks versus large stocks. For example, the correlation of the S&P 500 Index to the EAFE Index was 0.86 versus 0.76 for the EAFE Small Cap Index. We see the same result when looking at the correlation of the S&P 500 Index to the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. For large stocks, it was 0.76 versus 0.70 for small stocks.

The biggest error investors make is not including international stocks, thus missing out on the diversification benefits. However, even those who do include international stocks tend to only include broad indices that do not capture the premia offered by small and value stocks.

Because of their lower correlation and the higher expected returns of international small stocks (and even higher for small value stocks), you should consider including an allocation to them when constructing your portfolio. For example, using Dimensional indices, from 1990 through 2018, while the EAFE Index returned 4.4%, the Dimensional EAFE Small Cap Index returned 6.1% and the Dimensional EAFE Small Value Index returned 7.4%. Too many investors only include an allocation to the EAFE and Emerging Markets Indices.

Conclusion

Investors need to rethink their decision to allocate to the U.S. only. In this piece I have reviewed the behavioral error of recency bias that leads to this decision. I have explored other periods in history and demonstrated how this behavioral error worked for investors. Finally, I reviewed the literature concerning international investing, and formed the conclusion that the best diversification benefits from international investing comes from small cap and value stocks. Finally, a few ways for investors to invest in international markets.

While it is impossible for me to make a recommendation for any specific fund or allocation, as every investor's needs are different. I want to engage in a general discussion about possibilities for investors to reap the rewards from international diversification.

Factor Funds

The most direct way to gain access to the factor premiums is to invest in funds that directly target these premiums. Some funds that may work in this space are funds from Avantis Investors, or Dimensional Fund Advisors. As many of DFA's funds were conversions from their tax-managed mutual fund lineup, I like to use Avantis for tax advantaged accounts and DFA for taxable accounts. Avantis also has fund of fund solutions for international markets as well as international value stocks that are worth consideration.

Some funds for further research.

The funds presented are available at both Avantis and Dimensional (with the exception of the high profitability funds, which are Dimensional only,) so investors can choose which works best for them.

Avantis/DFA International Large Cap Value (AVLV)(DFIV)

DFA International High Profitability (DIHP)

Avantis/DFA EM Value (AVES)(DFEV)

DFA EM High Profitability (DEHP)

Avantis/DFA International Small Cap (AVDV) (DFIS)

Index Funds

If you are committed to using index funds, please read the methodology of the funds you are using. There can be real differences in results based on the index methodology.

Look no further than the domestic small cap market, where there is a real divergence between the S&P 600 Index and the Russell 2000. This is because the S&P 600 index imposes a profitability filter.

International indexes can also vary according to methodology and then subsequent performance divergence results. Also consider country concentration as we see with China in EM index funds.

One other consideration is currency hedging. I addressed this thoroughly here and came down on the side of whatever is best for your investor behavior is what you should do.

The evidence shows that it may reduce volatility, but over the long run should make no difference in returns. As we have been in a bull market for the US dollar, hedging has worked well for investors producing higher returns than owning international stocks on an unhedged basis.

This certainly can change in any period. In fact, many expect it to change, according to a recent study from Wellington Management Company the reversal of the trend in the U.S. dollar is a core part of their capital market assumptions which have EM stocks outpacing the U.S.

When the Federal Reserve eventually begins to back away from its tightening agenda, we could see an end to the dollar's impressive bull run. That may provide an opportunity for EM equities from the currency perspective - but also given that emerging markets have historically tended to perform better when the dollar is weak.

A reasonable compromise for investors may be to split their allocation in half with part hedged and part unhedged. For investors who want to combine index funds with factor funds, consider the iShares ACWI Ex-US Index (Hedged) (HAWX) and the iShares MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index (Hedged) (HSCZ), combined with value, and profitability funds from your preferred factor or active strategy. iShares also makes developed (HEFA), and EM (HEEM) hedged products for those who want to split the large cap allocation found in (HAWX) between developed and EM.

Active Management

While the record for active managers remains dismal, even in emerging markets, there is a case to be made for using active managers that have a focus on a specific style or strategy, exhibit relative low costs, or reduced risk exposure for investors by combining styles and factors.

Some funds to consider in this area are:

AQR

AQR International Momentum (AIONX)

AQR International Defensive (ANDNX)

AQR International Multi-Style (QICNX)

AQR Emerging Multi-Style II Fund (QTENX)

Dodge & Cox

Dodge & Cox International Stock (DODFX)

Dodge & Cox Emerging Markets (DODEX)

Regardless of which strategy you choose the case for adding and maintaining international stock exposure is well supported by the evidence. Pick a strategy that works best for you and stick with it as part of your well diversified, uncorrelated asset portfolio, over the long run.","['small', 'cap', 'investing', 'index', 'international', 'investors', 'market', 'diversification', 'case', 'funds', 'markets', 'stocks']",Seeking Alpha
"TMV ETF: FOMC Conference Next Week, A Key Potential Catalyst","Torsten Asmus

The Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3X Shares ETF (NYSEARCA:TMV) is a leveraged ETF, which we generally caution against. In this particular case TMV takes a 3x leveraged position against a portfolio of high duration Treasuries, meaning maximal duration sensitivity in addition to the leverage. This speculative instrument is suitable for investors who believe market expectations, particularly for long-term rates could rise further, causing the underlying index to fall and for TMV to rise. We believe there is somewhat of a case to be made on this, and think that next week may provide some catalysts for downside to long-duration Treasuries, as we are quite sure that inflation is not going to go down absent an aggressive rate policy.

Leveraged ETFs

It is necessary for us to caution against the use of leveraged ETFs, as they have features that make their behaviour unintuitive and essential to understand.

Because they reset daily after mimicking changes in the index that day by a -3x factor in the case of TMV, there is the problem of value erosion. While a 1% rebound after a 2% drop isn't so bad for the underlying index, having a 6% drop and a 2% rebound is more of a problem. There is a reason why Warren Buffett's #1 rule is, don't lose money. If you lose money, you have less to recover with, meaning for every drop you need a bigger percentage recovery to bring you back to square 1. If an asset drops 33%, you need an almost 50% recovery to recover. If an asset drops 50%, you need 100% recovery to breakeven.

Even if the next day is a bigger rebound than what you lost the previous day for the underlying index, with leveraged ETFs it is not very helpful because more money was lost the prior day, and the net movement of the underlying index won't be reflected in the performance of the leveraged ETF, which will start to demonstrate value erosion due to the resetting.

If you don't fully understand these risks, do not proceed with a leveraged ETF. They are best used over short durations because of value erosion. They are highly speculative burst instruments.

Links for reference on these risks:

TMV Specifically

With TMV the risks of the high 3x leverage, which tends to be the furthest these leveraged ETFs go, there is the added issue of high duration, which increases the sensitivity of the underlying portfolio to changes in rate expectations by markets, particularly longer-term rates which have been fluctuating a lot in the last couple of years.

The current state of affairs is that everyone is talking about rate hikes, even as early as March. The Fed started this narrative in its comments, where it said quite explicitly that it is happy where expectations are anchoring for inflation, and that the full effects of the current rate regime hasn't been reflected yet and therefore it must start to focus on the other side of its dual mandate, i.e on growth.

We do not buy this optimism that the inflation battle is won, and we look at a couple of very simple data to determine that there is still a problem.

Inflation expectations for the next year are still above 3%, and we don't care what Powell says about inflation expectations several years out from now, as they will be subject to change depending on how inflation evolves and how discussions around that evolve.

Wage growth rates are still way above 3%, and that is one of the fundamental drivers of inflation expectations, as workers and employers continue to try outrun each other.

3% is of course way above the 2% policy. While there is argument that the inflation rate in the US overstates inflation, as it doesn't allow for the effects of owning property and that not everyone pays rent, it's not that strong of an argument as rates as they are currently calculated are still the standard.

Next week, there are going to be several data releases on labour, namely the JOLTS report, and there will also be Fed comments where the Fed has the inside line on the economy and indicators of financial tightness and inflation.

On the matter of financial tightness, we also add the following:

Optimism undermines the inflation battle as it loosens credit conditions, rendering the benchmark rates ineffective in transmission. This is very much happening, we are seeing more private equity and debt transactions coming through lately, especially debt.

The USA always has high velocity of money, which can explain the differentials also compared to Europe, and the strong jobs market, labour turnover and more online hustling all contributes to this effective money supply as well.

Data by YCharts

Just to illustrate some of the behaviour of the ETF and how it might function as a bear instrument, observe the performance over the last month. This is a period in which markets went from an ebullient and extraordinary December and November 2023 where there was utter confidence in rate cuts and the end of market turmoil to now where there have appeared some doubts about the Fed's signals and what they mean for markets. TMV has rocketed compared to underlying 20+ Year Treasuries (TLT) captured by an iShares ETF called TLT (see above).

Of course, over the last three months, you can see how a bear bet against rate increases has failed. Although keep in mind that this is a longer horizon than what is ideal for an ETF like this, due to all the factors mentioned in the article's first section.

Data by YCharts

In all, we feel quite confident that the case is leaning towards upside surprises in rates for the year, where cuts are priced in imminently: unrealistic in our view.

Next week's jobs data will likely continue to show quite a lot of strength, as there is still a manpower problem in the labour force, and we think that the Fed just might start staging for higher for longer after all in its FOMC comments. TMV would benefit in that regard. As the catalysts come soon, value erosion effects will be less, and TMV is supposed to be used in bursts over short periods.

However, we would not take this position ourselves as it is too volatile and speculative.","['potential', 'tmv', 'index', 'rate', 'money', 'leveraged', 'rates', 'conference', 'key', 'catalyst', 'week', 'inflation', 'expectations', 'underlying', 'etf', 'fomc']",Seeking Alpha
Perion Network Stock: Navigating High Risks For High Rewards (NASDAQ:PERI),"Pgiam/iStock via Getty Images

Introduction

Perion Network's (NASDAQ:PERI) financial performance is impressive since the company's revenue growth multiple times outpaced the overall digital advertising market expansion in recent years. PERI's profitability is also expanding rapidly, and the company has a clean balance sheet. Perion is an innovative tech company, and its business model looks highly efficient. From the risks perspective, potential investors should be aware that Perion faces a substantial customer concentration risk. On the other hand, the stock is around 52% undervalued and has demonstrated robust momentum over the last three months. Overall, I think that PERI is a good investment opportunity for risk takers and assign it a ""Buy"" rating.

Fundamental analysis

Perion is a global, multi-channel advertising technology firm providing integrated solutions across key digital advertising avenues such as search, social media, display, video, and CTV advertising. All these channels intersect seamlessly within Perion's intelligent HUB (""iHUB"").

Perion

The company operates in the expanding digital advertising industry. I see several positive shifts that will catalyze the industry's sustainable growth. Despite tight monetary policies across developed economies, the global economy is still expected to expand by 2.4% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025. As a result of the resilient broader economic environment, marketing budgets are also expected to expand and surpass $1 trillion in 2024. Furthermore, The ongoing global trend toward digitalization is significantly impacting the advertising industry, with the share of digital ads anticipated to increase by approximately one percentage point each year. With all these solid tailwinds, I believe that Dentsu's recent report forecasting above 6% CAGR for the digital advertising market is fair.

Dentsu

From the above table, we can see that the global digital advertising market witnessed a robust 14.8% growth in 2022, and projections indicate a continued 6.3% year-over-year expansion in 2023. Notably, Perion has surpassed the industry average, achieving an impressive 33.8% revenue growth in 2022. Anticipated to maintain this momentum, PERI is forecasted for a remarkable 15.9% revenue growth for the full year 2023, significantly outperforming the broader digital advertising market. Outpacing the broader market growth is indicative of a company's ability to capture an increasing share of the market, showcasing its competitiveness and appeal to advertisers. Wall Street analysts expect PERI's revenue growth to outpace the broader digital advertising in 2024 and 2025 as well.

SA

The company's ability to deliver revenue growth outpacing the industry averages is impressive, but at the end of the day profitability dynamics is a more important factor affecting the stock price over the long-term. The chart below suggests a rapid expansion of the operating income, which outpaces the revenue growth as the operating margin also demonstrates an impressive upward trajectory. The free cash flow (""FCF"") has been volatile, but the dynamic is also positive. Another interesting positive fact is that Perion's headcount has grown by about only 10% since 2019, while the operating income has increased by more than five times. This underscores the high efficiency of the company's business model, which is good for investors.

Data by YCharts

Perion's balance sheet is healthy, with a solid half-a-billion cash position as of the latest reporting date. Debt levels are also very low. Having a clean balance sheet and improving profitability increases the chances that Perion will continue investing in growth, and its R&D investments will also remain substantial.

Yahoo Finance

Perion's exposure to various digital advertising channels makes it a well-rounded strategic partner for clients. The company also provides advanced analytics across different marketing campaigns, channels, and screens. This likely creates superior value in terms of higher ROI for clients. Perion uses artificial intelligence (""AI"") capabilities to create more value with its offerings. The company's SORT proprietary AI technology even won the Digiday Technology Award in September 2023.

Perion

Also, here are a few words regarding the upcoming Q4 earnings release planned for February 7. With the several EPS upward revisions over the last three months, I look optimistic about the upcoming earnings release. Wall Street analysts forecast an 11.5% YoY revenue growth for Q4 and the EPS expansion from $0.79 to $0.93. According to the earnings history, Perion very rarely misses consensus forecasts. Moreover, in Q1-Q3 2023, Perion delivered double-digit YoY revenue growth and notable EPS expansions. Therefore, I am optimistic about the upcoming earnings release.

SA

In conclusion, Perion emerges as a promising player in the ad tech industry, placing substantial emphasis on customer value through innovation. The company's robust financial performance, surpassing the broader digital advertising market, suggests that its strategic focus on innovation and diversification across various marketing channels is yielding significant benefits.

Valuation analysis

PERI reached its peak in April 2023 and is currently trading at approximately a 40% discount from last year's highs. While it has underperformed the U.S. stock market in the past 12 months, recent short-term momentum is noteworthy, with the stock posting a gain of nearly 15% in the last three months.

To simulate the discounted cash flow (""DCF"") model, I use a 12.3% WACC. The TTM FCF margin is 18.42%, which I expect to be expanding by 50 basis points every year. I use a 19.6% projected by consensus revenue growth for FY2024, but for the next three years, I use a 10% estimation, which is more conservative than consensus expects. The constant growth rate for the terminal value (""TV"") calculation is a conservative 3%. There are around 47 million PERI outstanding shares at the moment.

Calculated by the author

The DCF model provides a fair share price of almost $46. This is substantially higher than the current share price and means a 52% upside potential. The valuation is very attractive, but when the stock is that undervalued, there might be some red flags priced in. Therefore, I am moving on to mitigating factors.

Mitigating factors

Perion has a search advertising contract with Microsoft (MSFT), which accounts for more than one-third of the company's sales, according to the latest annual report. The contract is effective until December 31, 2024. There is no news regarding the contract renewal yet, which puts a notable portion of the company's revenue under substantial threat. Having a contract with Microsoft is a solid reputational asset, but it also creates significant concentration risks for Perion. There were no updates from the management regarding the contract renewal during the latest earnings call, which creates more uncertainty for investors.

In May 2023, Spruce Point Management published a comprehensive 127-page report investigating the accuracy of Perion's financial reports. The report is publicly available; I will not go into deep detail here. The report contains allegations that there might be material misstatements in Perion's financial statements, given its abnormal profitability relative to industry peers, a notable decline in insiders' ownership, and potential inconsistencies between impressive revenue growth and the proportion of sales allocated to growth (capex and R&D). The company's external auditor is a well-known and reputable company, EY. Furthermore, there was an official response from Perion, emphasizing that as a public company, Perion is highly regulated.

Perion is a highly regulated NASDAQ company that makes all required disclosures and takes all compliance measures.

The report's release had minimal impact on the stock price, with the current value remaining relatively unchanged compared to the day the report was made public.

Conclusion

In my assessment, Perion presents a compelling investment prospect with considerable upside potential that appears to outweigh the perceived risks. Despite the bearish report from Spruce Point Management, Perion's extensive high-profile client roster reflects a commitment to maintaining a positive reputation, which mitigates the risk of intentional financial misstatements. With impressive performance across key financial metrics and favorable industry trends, Perion seems well-positioned to sustain its upward trajectory. The stock merits a ""Buy"" rating, particularly for investors in search of a high-risk, high-reward opportunity.","['high', 'advertising', 'growth', 'risks', 'rewards', 'companys', 'stock', 'revenue', 'digital', 'navigating', 'perion', 'network', 'market', 'report', 'nasdaqperi', 'industry']",Seeking Alpha
AT&T Stock: The Ultimate Patience Tester (NYSE:T),"An investor waiting for AT&T to declare a dividend increase fstop123/iStock via Getty Images

Delivering Fiber Broadband Strategy Takes Time

Watching a stock like AT&T (NYSE:T) go nowhere for several years has tested the patience of many investors. If they would focus on the strategic priorities rather than the share price, they would see that the company is delivering what they set out to do following the spinoffs of non-core businesses. AT&T's capital spending program is also heavier than competitors due to the strategic decision to deliver most broadband services via fiber, rather than fixed wireless internet. While this is a short-term headwind to free cash flow, it will pay off over time as fiber is more scalable to cover future growth in subscribers and data usage. In the mean time, investors are paid to wait with a fully covered 6.7% dividend yield.

I have been covering AT&T's quarterly earnings for almost 5 years here on Seeking Alpha. During that time, it's delivered a negative total return, like its closest competitor Verizon (VZ) while T-Mobile (TMUS) has given investors nearly a double. If including the value of the Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) shares received in the 2022 spinoff, AT&T's total return has been about flat.

Seeking Alpha

Ever since the WBD spinoff and the partial sale of DirecTV, AT&T has focused on a simple 3-part strategy: grow the wireless and fiber businesses, reduce costs, and improve the balance sheet. The company is delivering on these goals, but progress has not been fast enough for investors, resulting in the languishing share price performance.

I rated AT&T a Buy last quarter because the 2023 free cash flow guidance raise provided some tangible evidence that the strategy was paying off. Since then, the stock has provided double-digit returns.

Seeking Alpha

The company exceeded the raised free cash flow guidance, but recently released 2024 guidance that showed less FCF growth than I expected. This does not change my thesis, but does reinforce the notion that it will take another year or so to play out.

Fourth quarter and full year 2023 results actually show decent operational and financial performance. In wireless, the company had net additions of 1.7 million postpaid phone subscribers for the full year, in contrast with just 0.4 million at Verizon. The small Latin America segment also has decent growth with improving margins. It turned EBITDA positive in 2022 and should soon have positive operating income as well. On the broadband side, AT&T added 1.1 million fiber customers during the year, but this was offset by an equal number of non-fiber customer losses. The fiber customers generate higher revenue per user, so the consumer wireline business overall grew EBITDA by about 10%. Offsetting these positives is an expected decline in the Business Wireline segment, which looked worse than trend in 4Q23 due to one-time gain from selling intellectual property in 4Q22. Putting it all together, the company grew full year revenue by 1.4% and adjusted EBITDA by 4.6%. This was better than Verizon's full year results of -0.3% revenue decline and -0.6% adjusted EBITDA decline. AT&T's free cash flow improved by 18.6% to $16.8 billion. This was above the improved guidance the company provided last quarter. This result was less than Verizon's free cash flow improvement of 32.6% to $18.1 billion, however. Verizon's capital spending dropped much more than AT&T's last year.

AT&T

There appears to be one key part of AT&T's strategy producing this drag on free cash flow growth relative to its competitors. This will continue to impact performance in the short term but could pay off later, requiring investor patience. Verizon and T-Mobile have decided to focus on Fixed Wireless Access as the main delivery mode for broadband. FWA requires less capital spending to implement and can be rolled out faster to customers. This is where Verizon has a big current advantage. Verizon added 1.5 million FWA broadband subscribers in 2023, but these were not just offsets from older technology as with AT&T. In fact, Verizon still added 0.2 million Fios and DSL subscribers last year.

Verizon

AT&T management still maintain that fiber is the best way to deliver broadband to a fixed location because it lasts a long time and is easier to scale up for higher data usage in the future. Nevertheless, it requires more investment up front. As CEO John Stankey said on the earnings call,

I obviously believe that we should not be at the sustained levels of investment that we're at right now for ever. Our point of view is, we're building infrastructure that's sustainable infrastructure that will build a franchise that will last for many years to come. The fiber investment is a hard one to do at the front end, but it's an incredibly durable investment. The depreciation levels on this go out a long time for a reason. And the beauty of the technology is, improving capacity on it is a relatively light lift incrementally once you got the glass in the ground.

AT&T has become a bit more flexible as they see their competitors gain broadband share. They now offer their own FWA product called AT&T Internet Air and are investing in Open Radio Access Network technology to help the wireless network deliver more FWA service. However, this spending on ORAN and fiber increases capex (impacting FCF) and depreciation (impacting operating income), putting a drag on 2024 guidance relative to investor expectations. Recall at the time of the WBD spinoff, AT&T expected to deliver $20 billion FCF in 2023. It now looks like they will not reach this level in 2024 either, and impatient investors are punishing the stock, down 3% on the day of the earnings release.

Disappointing 2024 Guidance

Initial guidance for 2024 shows slowing growth. Wireless service revenues are expected to be up 3% (compared to 4.4% growth in 2023). Broadband revenues are expected to be up at least 7%, after growing 8.1% in 2023. Overall company EBITDA is expected to grow 3% this year, vs. 4.7% in 2023. While growth is slowing, the wireless service revenue and EBITDA growth levels are at the top of the range of what Verizon is forecasting for this year.

AT&T capital investment is expected to be $21-$22 billion in 2024, down about $2 billion at the midpoint from the 2023 actual value of $23.6 billion. Verizon capex is expected to be only $17-$17.5 billion, down about $1.5 billion from last year's actual.

AT&T Verizon

The higher capital intensity at AT&T is driving the low free cash flow growth, only up 4.2% at the midpoint from the 2023 result. With this low growth, AT&T shares could continue to get punished by investors in 2024. The quarter-to-quarter FCF delivery is expected to be a little smoother this year, but still weighted 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. That implies FCF of just $3.5 billion in 1Q which, even though on plan, could produce a free cash flow freak out like we saw when 1Q 2023 results were released. Those investors who do want to try bottom fishing may want to wait one quarter before buying.

AT&T has a good chance of delivering the FCF guidance, as the capex and FCF guidance on the slide above implies operating cash flow of $38 - $40 billion. The company delivered $38.3 billion operating cash flow in 2023, plus DirecTV cash dividends of $2 billion. While the DirecTV dividend will be down slightly, it is hard to see operating cash flow going down with 3% EBITDA growth.

The Dividend Is Still Safe, Just Not Growing Yet

Free cash flow at the midpoint of guidance is $17.5 billion for 2024. The $0.2775 quarterly dividend will use $8 billion of cash. There is $9.5 billion of debt due this year. Following the offloading of debt onto WBD at the time of the 2022 spinoff, the company has been painfully slow to pare its debt further. This was mainly due to the need for spectrum investments of $10.2 billion in 2022 and $2.9 billion in 2023. Without the need for further spectrum licenses, AT&T can now apply its free cash flow after dividends to debt reduction. AT&T ended 2023 with $128.9 billion of net debt and EBITDA of $43.4 billion for a leverage ratio of 2.97. (Verizon was at 3.05 leverage when calculated on a consistent basis.) This is an improvement of just $3.4 billion in debt from the end of 2022, when leverage was 3.19. Looking forward to 2024, guidance is for EBITDA of $44.7 billion. If the company indeed pays down all the debt due this year without refinancing, net debt will be $119.4 billion and leverage will be 2.67 at the end of 2024.

The desire to hit this leverage level, on the way to the stated target of 2.5 leverage by the first half of 2025, will constrain AT&T from any dividend increases this year. After that point, lower capex and the reduced need to pay off debt will allow more capital return to shareholders. Long-term, management expects capex requirements to be around a ""mid teens"" percentage of revenue. That means if sales are $125 billion, capex would be $18.75 billion, about $2.75 billion lower than the 2024 plan. That alone would free up $0.095 per quarter for dividend increases (34% above the current level). Applying cash toward dividends or buybacks instead of further debt reduction after reaching the leverage target is also a possibility. The company will look at interest rates, the share price, and opportunities for growth capex in deciding how to use this cash. Unfortunately, I think we have another 18 months to go before AT&T is in a position to consider a dividend increase. More patience is required.

Valuation And Peer Comparison

Updating the comparison from last quarter's article, AT&T's discount to Verizon has widened to 23% on a forward P/E basis, compared to 12% last quarter. AT&T P/E remains around 2/3 cheaper than T-Mobile (TMUS) on current year earnings, but this gap narrows in the out years because of T-Mobile's perceived faster growth. AT&T is now 6%-8% cheaper than Verizon on an EV/sales and EV/EBITDA basis, compared to being valued the same last quarter.

Seeking Alpha

The wider discount for AT&T does not seem warranted considering AT&T's slightly better revenue and EBITDA growth projections for 2024. Verizon currently has lower capex and better free cash flow growth, but I expect this to reverse once AT&T has completed its fiber buildout. The problem is, I thought this would have already happened by this year, so I can understand if investors are suspicious of it happening even in 2025. Until it becomes clearer that the company will deliver results, I don't see the share price moving much, but with good news, I maintain last quarter's price target of $20 which implies AT&T P/E equalizing with Verizon. Last quarter, this price target was based on free cash flow reaching $20 billion and a price/FCF multiple of 7.2. Given the lower FCF guidance for 2024, I now expect the price target to be reached in 2025.

Looking at Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings, T continues to be ranked slightly higher than VZ, with an edge on valuation and EPS revisions. Both are still disadvantaged to T-Mobile on Growth. T-Mobile's Growth rating benefits from not having the declining legacy wireline business, but the D Valuation rating suggests that paying 3x the P/E for T-Mobile compared to AT&T means you could be overpaying for that growth.

Risks

AT&T management seems to share my optimism for a healthy economy this year, based on SEO John Stankey's comments on the earnings call.

We haven't seen anything with the consumer that suggests they're not paying their bills or not in a position to continue to buy services from us. We certainly don't see anything in business formation right now that causes us any degree of concern at this juncture. So by and large, I think we feel like we're in a pretty good place moving into 2024, absent what I would call big exogenous variables in the global system that occurs. We feel like policy will probably line up pretty well.

If the company has a healthy economy built into its plan, then any significant slowdown in the would likely cause results to come in lower than plan.

A couple of government programs were discussed on the call. While the customers served by these programs likely produce lower than average revenue per user, they could still impact AT&T's decisions on how they will serve these markets and how the company will spend capital. The first is the Affordable Connectivity Program, or ACP, due to end in February. It is basically a $30 per month subsidy for internet service which could impact demand negatively once it ends. The other program is BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) which came out of the 2021 Infrastructure and Jobs Act. It allocates $42.5 billion to the states and territories for broadband deployment, but without any federal management. Each state may use the money differently, resulting in the need for AT&T to have 50+ different contacts to participate in the projects.

Finally, the Wall Street Journal resurfaced the lead cable issue again this month, but management again made no mention of it on the earnings call and no analysts asked any questions about it. According to the company, less than 10% of the legacy copper network contains lead-clad cables, and most of these are underground or in conduit where they do not pose a serious exposure risk.

Conclusion

AT&T continues to deliver its focused 5G and fiber growth strategy, with results showing up in subscriber growth. The company exceeded its 2023 free cash flow target but forecasted weak FCF growth in 2024. This is due at least in part to the higher capex costs of the fiber program compared to the fixed wireless solution being rolled out by the two main competitors. Impatient investors have punished AT&T stock, widening the discount compared to Verizon almost by almost twice as much as it was one quarter ago.

Nevertheless, AT&T can easily pay its 6.6% dividend this year with cash left over to pay off the debt due without needing to refinance. Capex will come down eventually, and when it does, AT&T will be in a better position than its competitors on further growth of broadband services, thanks to fiber's better scalability. Lower capex, along with reaching the 2.5 leverage target in 2025, will allow for increased dividends and a likely recovery of the share price to the $20 area, if investors can be patient for a while longer.","['free', 'flow', 'growth', 'tester', 'company', 'ultimate', 'stock', 'nyset', 'att', 'verizon', '2024', '2023', 'patience', 'billion', 'cash']",Seeking Alpha
NTT Stock: New Growth Business And Share Buybacks Draw Attention (OTCMKTS:NPPXF),"winhorse/iStock Unreleased via Getty Images

Elevator Pitch

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (OTCPK:NPPXF) [9432:JP] or NTT Corporation is rated as a Buy.

The outlook for NTT Corporation's new IOWN or Innovative Optical And Wireless Network business associated with photonics-electronics convergence devices is positive, considering that the company is aggressively investing in this new growth area. Also, NTT Corporation's recent faster-than-expected pace of share repurchases suggests that the company's shares are trading at below fair valuation. My Buy rating for NTT Corporation stays unchanged after assessing these key factors relating to growth and valuations.

NTT Corporation's shares are traded on the Japanese stock market and the Over-The-Counter market. The 10-day mean daily trading values for NTT Corporation's OTC shares and shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange were around $4 million and $200 million, respectively as per S&P Capital IQ data. Investors can trade in the company's more liquid Japanese shares with US brokers like Interactive Brokers.

IOWN Is A Key Growth Business For NTT

Last month, NTT Corporation published a press release disclosing that it formed a ""capital and business alliance"" with Japanese technology company ACCESS Co., Ltd. or ACCESS to ""accelerate IOWN"" or Innovative Optical And Wireless Network.

An Overview Of Innovative Optical And Wireless Network Or IOWN

NTT's Corporate Website

Details Of The Partnership Between NTT Corporation And ACCESS

NTT Corporation's December 13, 2023 Press Release

As indicated in the company's December 13, 2023 media release, NTT Corporation's goal is to create new ""IOWN services and products to provide low-power servers equipped with photonics-electronics convergence devices in the future."" This recently announced partnership between NTT Corporation and ACCESS is part of the former's efforts to leverage on IOWN as a key mid-to-long term growth driver.

NTT Corporation has set a financial target of growing the company's EBITDA by a five-year CAGR of +4% to JPY4 trillion in fiscal year 2027 (April 1, 2027 to March 31, 2028). The achievement of NTT Corporation's FY 2027 EBITDA goal is dependent on the company's ability to increase its EBITDA contribution from new growth businesses as a proportion of total EBITDA from 39% for FY 2022 to 48% in FY 2027. As per the chart presented below, IOWN is one of NTT Corporation's new growth businesses that play a big role in the company's intermediate-term EBITDA expansion plans.

New Growth Businesses For NTT Corporation

NTT Corporation's Corporate Presentation Slides

The company has already made various investments to support the future growth of its IOWN business as disclosed in its corporate presentation slides.

One example is the acquisition of stakes in other companies. NTT Corporation has proposed to purchase a 12.9% equity interest (exact deal consideration wasn't revealed) in ACCESS which is part of its recently announced partnership that was highlighted above.

Another example is R&D investments. NTT Corporation has budgeted for Research & Development or R&D costs amounting to JPY100 billion relating to the development of IOWN solutions for FY 2023 (April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024).

In the middle of last year, the company created a new entity called ""NTT Innovative Devices Corporation"" to be responsible for the production of photonic-electronic convergence devices.

It is worth highlighting that the current consensus FY 2027 EBITDA forecast for NTT Corporation is JPY3,867 billion (source: S&P Capital IQ), which is -3.4% lower than the company's FY 2027 EBITDA target of JPY4,000 billion. In other words, it is reasonable to infer from the consensus numbers that the market isn't very confident that NTT Corporation can meet its medium-term EBITDA goal.

In my view, NTT Corporation can deliver a positive surprise by meeting the company's FY 2027 EBITDA target of JPY4 trillion considering the company's recent moves to enhance the growth prospects of its IOWN business.

Company Repurchased Shares At A Faster-Than-Expected Pace

At the beginning of the current year, NTT Corporation issued an announcement which offered an update on the status of the company's ongoing share buybacks. It is encouraging to know that the company has been repurchasing its own shares at an aggressive pace.

In the January 5, 2024 disclosure, the company noted that it has spent JPY193.6 billion on share repurchases between August 10, 2023 and December 22, 2023. With just three months remaining till the expiry of its share buyback plan (March 29, 2024 expiry date), NTT Corporation has already completed close to 97% of its proposed JPY200 billion share repurchase program. It is safe to assume that the probability of NTT Corporation completing its share buyback program at an earlier-than-expected time is pretty high.

I am of the opinion that there are two positive takeaways from NTT Corporation's faster-than-expected pace of share buybacks.

The first favorable takeaway is that NTT Corporation is committed to rewarding the company's shareholders with capital return initiatives like buybacks and it is also disciplined with the allocation of capital.

In its corporate presentation slides, NTT Corporation emphasized that it is buying back its own shares so as to ""improve capital efficiency and enhance shareholder return."" The company has sent a clear message that it is ""walking the talk"" with its accelerated share repurchases.

The second positive takeaway is that the company's management believes that the stock is undervalued. NTT Corporation's Japan-listed shares with the 9432:JP ticker symbol have gone up by +16% between August 10, 2023 and January 23, 2024. Notwithstanding the meaningful capital appreciation for its shares in the past few months, NTT Corporation has continued to repurchase its own shares at a rapid pace during this same time frame.

As mentioned in the preceding section, NTT Corporation's high-growth businesses like ""IOWN, digital/data centers, power/energy, Smart Life, real estate, AI/robots"" are projected to account for almost half (48% to be exact) of the company's EBITDA in FY 2027. I think that it is reasonable for NTT Corporation's consensus next twelve months' EV/EBITDA multiple to expand from the current 7.3 times (source: S&P Capital IQ) to 10 times or higher. This takes into consideration expectations that the company's operating earnings mix becomes more favorable over time with growing exposure to businesses leveraged to secular growth areas such as AI, data centers, and IOWN.

Concluding Thoughts

I still have a Buy rating for NTT Corporation. My opinion is that NTT Corporation can meet its JPY4 trillion EBITDA target for FY 2027 with its investments in new growth businesses like IOWN, and I also view the stock as undervalued considering the changes to its business mix.

Florida House passes bill to ban minors from social media,"The Florida House of Representatives passed a bipartisan legislation that bans minors under the age of 16 from creating social media accounts.

The bill, known as HB 1, also requires social media platforms to terminate existing accounts of such minors and verify the ages of account holders.

Note that HB 1 would not apply to websites used for email, messaging, streaming, and online shopping, among others. This will likely cause confusion over which companies need to comply with the law.

The bill will now go to the state's Senate for approval, before heading to Governor Ron DeSantis' desk. If it is cleared, it would go into effect in July.

""Social media use correlates with increasing mental health challenges among children,"" said Florida House Speaker Paul Renner. ""HB 1 will protect them, and prevent this from happening to another generation.""

The House also passed another bill, known as HB 3, aimed at curbing minors' access to websites featuring adult content.

Other states that have tried to limit social media access for minors are Ohio, Arkansas, and Utah. However, lawsuits claiming the state's bills are unconstitutional are currently blocking such efforts.

California is also engaged in a legal battle over a proposed law meant to safeguard children online.

For starters, I have a strong suspicion that China is playing a role in manipulating the price of lithium by putting out hyped up headlines stating that they found the world’s largest deposit of lithium. However, that discovery does not seem to slow down their recent consolidation spree across Western Europe, Africa and South America.

On top of that, global supply chains are already shaky as fuck. This is where well positioned lithium mines and refineries will be in the blast radius of a major tailwind in the next 12 to 18 months:

The EV / automaker bloodshed will continue for a few more months in North America until election happens. Foreign market demand will continue to grow. Regardless of conservative opposition we will see the US push through a federal mandate with very hard deadlines on EV adoption. Lithium Ion batteries will reign supreme for longer than you think. Sodium-ion batteries are less dense, less storage capacity, and have limitations of flexibility as they cannot be turned into various shapes like prismatic, cylindrical etc. Hydrogen is not even on the table. Consolidation - Lithium miner consolidation is increasing rapidly. From hostile takeovers to junior miner acquisitions.

Airlines Hoping for More Boeing Jets Could Be Waiting Awhile,"Boeing hoped 2024 would be the year it would significantly increase production of its popular Max jets. But less than a month into the year, the company is struggling to reassure airline customers that it will still be able to deliver on its promises.

That’s because the Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday that it would limit the plane maker’s output until it was confident in Boeing’s quality control practices. On Jan. 5, a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 body shortly after takeoff, terrifying passengers on an Alaska Airlines flight and forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at Portland International Airport in Oregon. Almost immediately, the F.A.A. grounded some Max 9s.

Since then, details have emerged about the jet’s production at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Wash., that have intensified scrutiny of the company’s quality control. Boeing workers opened and then reinstalled the panel about a month before the plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines.

The directive is another setback for Boeing, which had been planning to increase production of its Max plane series to more than 500 this year, from about 400 last year. It also planned to add another assembly line at a factory in Everett, Wash., a major Boeing production hub north of Seattle.","['boeing', 'production', 'increase', 'max', 'awhile', 'wash', 'panel', 'waiting', 'plane', 'airlines', 'jets', 'month', 'hoping', 'quality']",New York Times
"As China’s Markets Stumble, Japan Rises Toward Record","There’s a shift underway in Asia that’s reverberating through global financial markets.

Japan’s stock market, overlooked by investors for decades, is making a furious comeback. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index is edging closer to the record it set on Dec. 29, 1989, which effectively marked the peak of Japan’s economic ascendancy before a collapse that led to decades of low growth.

China, long an impossible-to-ignore market, has been spiraling downward. Stocks in China recently touched lows not seen since a rout in 2015, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was the worst-performing major market in the world last year. Stocks stemmed their slide only when Beijing recently signaled its intention to intervene but remain far below previous highs.

This year was set to be a tumultuous one for global markets, with unpredictable swings as economic fortunes diverge and voters in more than 50 countries go to the polls. But there’s one unforeseen reversal already underway: a change in perception among investors about China and Japan.

Seizing on this shift, Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, addressed more than 3,000 global financiers gathered in Hong Kong this week for a conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs.

"Edward E. Crutchfield, 82, Banker Whose Deals Reshaped the Industry, Dies","Edward E. Crutchfield, a banker who grew a small North Carolina bank into one of the nation’s largest through a deal-making spree that earned him the nickname “Fast Eddie” and helped establish Charlotte as a national financial hub, died on Jan. 2 at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 82.

His death was confirmed by his son, Elliott Crutchfield, who said his father had dementia.

When Mr. Crutchfield graduated from business school in 1965, he took a job as a credit analyst at First Union bank in Charlotte, N.C. It was the lowest-paying job he was offered but he thought he could move up faster at a smaller bank. He sensed opportunity, he told his family and colleagues, at the bank and in the region.

Both hunches paid off. At age 32, just seven years after he joined First Union, he became its president and was thought to be the youngest person in the country to hold that title at a sizable bank. His ambitions were broadened by a 1985 Supreme Court ruling legalizing interstate banking. The decision empowered Mr. Crutchfield, by then his bank’s chairman and chief executive, to gobble up rival banks and failed thrifts, transforming First Union into a super-regional bank with thousands of branches throughout the Southeast.

“I just had a feeling that what turned out to be the Sun Belt would be a good bet,” he told The New York Times in 1983, shortly before he began his buying binge. “I guess we’re rubbing the rabbit’s foot the right way.”","['dies', 'bank', 'crutchfield', '82', 'job', 'youngest', 'thought', 'edward', 'told', 'mr', 'banker', 'deals', 'union', 'charlotte', 'reshaped', 'industry', 'banks']",New York Times
Scheduled to Fly on a Boeing Max 9? Here Are Your Options.,"After a portion of an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliner’s fuselage blew out in midair minutes after taking off from Portland, Ore., on Jan. 5, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded about 170 Max 9 planes, causing airlines that rely heavily on the aircraft to cancel thousands of flights and inconveniencing many passengers.

On Wednesday, the F.A.A. approved inspection and maintenance procedures for the planes, clearing the way for the grounded Max 9 planes to fly again.

Airlines said they planned to resume flying the Max 9s this week. Here’s what passengers should know about the plane and their rights if they want to avoid flying on it.

Which airlines use the Max 9?

Of the 215 Boeing Max 9 airplanes flown globally, United Airlines operates 79, the most of any airline, and Alaska has 65, according to Cirium, an aviation data provider.

Intel sinks after first quarter outlook disappoints,"Intel (INTC) stock fell more than 10% in premarket trade on Friday after the chipmaker reported fourth quarter results that topped estimates but offered an outlook for the current quarter that came in below expectations.

For the first quarter, Intel said Thursday it expects adjusted earnings per share to total $0.13, well below the $0.34 analysts were expecting, according to data from Bloomberg. Revenue in the current quarter is expected to come in between $12.2 billion-$13.2 billion; analysts had expected first quarter revenue to come in closer to $14.2 billion.

In the fourth quarter, Intel reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.54, better than the $0.44 expected by analysts, while revenue came in at $15.4 billion, better than the $15.2 billion expected.

CFO David Zinsner said the company ""comfortably achieved"" its goal of delivering cost savings north of $3 billion in 2023.

Looking at the company's business units, Intel also saw results in its Data Center and AI unit fall short of expectations, with revenues tallying $4 billion in the fourth quarter, below Street estimates for $4.1 billion. This marked a 10% decline from the same quarter last year.

The data center and AI business is Intel's opportunity to take on rivals including Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). In December, CEO Pat Gelsinger showed off the company's upcoming Gaudi3 accelerator designed to power generative AI software and services.

The chipmaker's Client Computing Group posted fourth quarter sales of $8.8 billion, better than the $8.4 billion forecast by analysts and up 33% from a year ago.

The company is also in the middle of its plan to become a foundry for other chip companies. Its Intel foundry services division is expected to have generated $291 million in revenue during the quarter, less than the $343 million expected by analysts.

On Wednesday, Intel announced the opening of its latest chip manufacturing facility in New Mexico. Intel is in the midst of a yearslong turnaround effort seeking to put the semiconductor maker back on top of the chip world after losing manufacturing leadership and market share to rivals like TSMC and AMD.

Story continues

Intel's results come as the company is seeking to push its own AI bona fides and follows the debut of its Core Ultra line of PC chips in December, which Intel says will let consumers run AI apps directly on their laptops and desktops.

Gelsinger said in a press release the company this year remains ""relentlessly focused on achieving process and product leadership, continuing to build our external foundry business and at-scale global manufacturing, and executing our mission to bring AI everywhere as we drive long-term value for stakeholders.""

Over the last six months, Intel stock had gained 45% before Friday's premarket decline.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger speaks during an event called AI Everywhere in New York, Thursday, Dec. 14, 2023. (Seth Wenig/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

Intel is hoping its Core Ultra line of chips will further goose PC sales in the year ahead as consumers and enterprise customers who purchased new laptops and desktops at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 begin to look for replacement devices.

The Core Ultra includes a neural processing unit, or NPU, which allows PCs to run certain AI applications locally rather than requiring users to rely on cloud-based applications. The idea is that NPUs will let users access AI apps without having to be online. That would ensure users’ data stays on their devices rather than requiring them to send it to an AI firm’s servers.

But it’s still unclear exactly how useful onboard AI will actually be for consumers. And even Intel admits that it’s not quite sure what AI applications will look like outside of a few early examples such as local versions of ChatGPT-like apps and AI image-editing software.

Intel Plunges After Forecast Casts Doubt on Comeback Bid,"(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. tumbled in premarket trading after delivering a disappointing forecast on Thursday, renewing doubts about a long-promised turnaround at the once-dominant chipmaker.

Most Read from Bloomberg

Intel’s first-quarter projection for both sales and profit came in well short of Wall Street estimates, and executives struggled to soothe concerns during a conference call with analysts.

The outlook suggests that Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger still has a long way to go in restoring Intel’s former prowess. Though the chipmaker’s personal computer business is recovering, demand is weakening in the lucrative market for data center chips.

Intel also is contending with a slowdown in programmable chips and components for self-driving vehicles, and a fledgling business that makes semiconductors for other companies hasn’t yet taken off.

Intel shares fell more than 12% in premarket trading before New York exchanges opened after closing at $49.55 on Thursday. If the decline in early trading holds, Intel will be set for its biggest fall since October 2021. The stock was already down 1.4% so far this month, trailing a 7.1% advance by the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.

Sales in the first quarter will be $12.2 billion to $13.2 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said. That compared with an average analyst estimate of $14.25 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit will be 13 cents a share, minus certain items, versus a projection of 34 cents.

During the conference call, Gelsinger acknowledged that the first quarter wasn’t going as well as hoped, but that he expected the rest of 2024 to improve quarter by quarter. Intel’s efforts to return to the cutting edge of manufacturing are still on track, he said. That’s crucial to improving its products and staying competitive. He also asserted that the chipmaker is no longer losing sales to competitors in PCs and data centers.

“We know we have much work in front of us as we work to regain and build on our leadership position in every category in which we participate,” Gelsinger said.

One of the most ambitious pieces of Gelsinger’s plan is a push into manufacturing chips for others — a field known as the foundry industry. Intel committed to spending heavily on a network of plants around the world to further that effort. But the company hasn’t yet gone public with the names of large customers participating in the project.

Without getting specific, Intel said Thursday that it had $10 billion worth of “lifetime deal value” orders to make and package chips for other companies — evidence of progress in this new area.

Under questioning, Gelsinger said that the deals it has booked so far aren’t enough.

“Obviously, we need to, as your question suggests, get to a much bigger number, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do,” he said.

Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have remained the stock-market darlings of the chip sector, largely because investors expect them to benefit the most from a surge in spending on artificial intelligence-related infrastructure.

Gelsinger said that Intel will make headway in the market for so-called AI accelerators — Nvidia-style chips that help speed the development of artificial intelligence models. The growth of the AI industry will also increase demand for Intel’s regular data center processors, he said.

But Intel’s efforts to upgrade its facilities will weigh on profitability this year — with the hoped-for payoff not coming until later.

Intel’s gross margin — the portion of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — will be 44.5% in the first quarter. That compares with an estimate of 45.5%. Prior to the onset of its current problems around 2019, Intel typically reported profitability of well over 60%.

In the fourth quarter, earnings came in at 54 cents a share on sales of $15.4 billion. Analysts had estimated profit of 44 cents and revenue of $15.2 billion.

Data center sales were $4 billion, falling short of the average projection of $4.08 billion. Client computing, Intel’s PC chip business, had sales of $8.84 billion. That compared with an estimate of about $8.42 billion.

Intel has said that the market for PCs is emerging from a glut of inventory and its largest customers are returning to ordering parts. Total PC shipments should rise to about 300 million units a year, Gelsinger has said, helped by demand for new machines that are better able to handle artificial intelligence software and services. The total for 2023 was about 270 million, and growth will be a few percentage points this year, he said.

In servers, where Intel once had a market share of more than 99%, the company is facing more competition and a shift in spending patterns. Longtime rival AMD has fielded increasingly powerful chips that are winning over customers. In another troubling sign for Intel, some of the world’s biggest spenders on the technology – including Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Microsoft Corp. – are designing their own processors.

Intel’s outlook also has been clouded by a division that it partially spun off. Earlier this month, Mobileye Global Inc., a maker of autonomous driving technology, gave a full-year forecast that was well below analysts’ predictions. Intel is still the majority owner of the Israel company.

The S&P 500 Just Hit An All-Time High. Here's 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock That Still Looks Like a Bargain,"Over the last year, a big contributor to the momentum in the market has been hype around artificial intelligence (AI). The overall bullish outlook on the technology seems to have carried over into 2024. This week, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high level of 4,868.55.

Some of the biggest contributors to the market over the last 12 months are the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks -- a moniker used to describe the largest technology enterprises by market cap. As of the time of this article, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks boast market capitalizations of over $1 trillion -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. However, with a market cap of $980 billion, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could very well be the next to join and firmly remain in the exclusive club.

In 2023, Meta stock returned 194% -- handily outperforming the broader markets. With such outsize returns and the overall market soaring to new highs, is it time to book some gains in Meta stock?

A thorough analysis of the company's financial and operational picture may show that the stock trades for a bargain. Let's look at Meta and assess if now is a good opportunity to scoop up some shares.

Meta's financial profile is rock-solid

In 2022, Meta made a big bet on virtual reality (VR) as it turned its focus to the metaverse. However, investors quickly soured on these new ambitions as the company's revenue decelerated and expenses rose. While the metaverse is still part of the company's long-term vision, Meta spent much of 2023 returning to its advertising roots and right-sizing its cost profile.

Through the first nine months of 2023, Meta's total revenue increased 12% year over year, while free cash flow grew by 140%. A return to advertising growth coupled with multiple rounds of layoffs helped Meta get back on track. As such, the company has been able to swiftly reinvest these excess profits back into the business.

What growth drivers does the company have?

When it comes to AI, Meta has a couple of interesting opportunities.

Story continues

First, the company already has a series of VR hardware devices through its Reality Labs business. Currently, Reality Labs only constitutes about 1% of Meta's total revenue. Moreover, hefty research and development (R&D) and marketing costs are taking a toll on this division, as it does not yet generate positive operating margins.

Nevertheless, one of the company's recent augmented reality (AR) developments could be a tangential growth driver for Meta's current VR headsets and the overall Reality Labs business. Meta's smart glasses are a unique new piece of hardware the company is testing. Although competitors like Alphabet have attempted to commercialize similar products in the past, I am bullish that Meta will be able to integrate smart glasses into its existing VR and AR infrastructure and bolster its Reality Labs operation.

Another catalyst Meta currently has is its generative AI model, Llama 2. Llama 2 already has many impressive partners, including cybersecurity firms such as Palo Alto Networks, workplace automation services including Atlassian, and cloud providers like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each of these end markets is enormous and becoming increasingly reliant on AI applications. While it's still early days, Meta is quietly setting itself up to enjoy long-term secular tailwinds from key markets such as cloud computing, among others.

Meta stock looks like a bargain

As of the time of this article, Meta stock is already up 8% this year. But even so, the company trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.9 -- nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. This could signal that investors do not expect Meta to outperform the broader markets.

META Price to Free Cash Flow Chart

I see Meta as an undervalued growth stock whose ambitions in artificial intelligence are not fully understood. Meta stock looks historically cheap at a price-to-free cash flow of just 26.7. Moreover, given the toll Reality Labs currently takes on Meta's overall profitability, the company's total earnings could actually be even higher -- suggesting the stock could be even cheaper than it looks.

As concerns around the macroeconomy begin to improve, Meta looks well-positioned to benefit from the AI movement -- an industry that can fuel both the company's advertising and VR businesses. While it's already experienced a slight bump in the first few weeks of the year, now still looks like an incredible opportunity to scoop up shares in Meta given the stock's discount to historical valuations.

The Dow will surge 24% after the Fed's first rate cut with recession looking unlikely,"The Dow will surge 24% after the Fed's first rate cut with recession looking unlikely

The stock market could have 24% upside after the Fed launches its first interest-rate cut later this year.

Ned Davis research crunched the numbers and found that interest-rate cuts, coupled with no recession, create a very bullish environment for stocks.

""The bottom line is that the stock market has tended to rally in the year after the first cut,"" NDR said.

The stock market is poised for considerable upside as the Federal Reserve gears up for its first interest-rate cut since 2019, according to a Thursday note from Ned Davis Research.

Ed Clissold, chief US strategist at Ned Davis Research, crunched the numbers and found that the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumps 15% on average in the first year after the Fed's first interest rate cut. But those gains are even stronger, at 24%, when the interest rate cuts are coupled with no recession in the economy.

""The Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied more when a recession has not occurred within a year before or after the first cut,"" Clissold said.

The Fed has signaled that it plans to cut interest rates at least three times this year after inflation has moderated considerably from its June 2022 peak. Meanwhile, solid GDP growth and a resilient jobs market has signaled to investors that a recession does not appear imminent, setting the stock market up for solid gains ahead.

If the average 24% gain after the first interest rate cut during a no recession period were to materialize, the Dow Jones would trade to about 47,000. That level lines up with a recent bullish call from All Star Charts' JC Parets, who said the Dow Jones could surge to 50,000 if the US dollar breaks down.

""The bottom line is that the stock market has tended to rally in the year after the first cut,"" Clissold said.

Boeing production woes 'will get resolved' says major customer Avolon,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Boeing's production difficulties will ""get resolved"", its 737 MAX 10 aircraft will get certified and the impact of U.S. regulators freezing a planned production ramp-up will be minimal this year, the head of major customer Avolon said.

In the medium term, however, tighter regulation will cause delays and it could take until the end of the decade for the industry to make up the production shortfall experienced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Avolon CEO Andy Cronin said in an interview.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Wednesday froze planned increases in production of the 737 MAX following the blow-out of a panel on an Alaska Airlines Boeing jet, raising concerns for airlines and suppliers worldwide.

Avolon, the world's third-largest aircraft lessor and a major Boeing customer with over 100 MAX aircraft on order, said it was not concerned about the plane's safety, but regulators' increased focus on production was set to result in production delays. ""They'll clearly be very cautious now,"" Cronin said.

Avolon, a subsidiary of China's Bohai Leasing Co Ltd, estimates the shortfall in planned aircraft production in the wake of COVID equals 12% of annual production and is growing.

A combination of quality and supply chain issues and manufacturing delays ""will continue to elongate the recovery time, which at this point, is through the end of this decade,"" Cronin said.

But ultimately Boeing has the technical expertise and production know-how to get back on track, he said. ""This will come together and will get resolved.""

The number of MAX aircraft that will not be delivered due to the FAA's decision to halt the production expansion ""is actually relatively minimal"" so long as Boeing can consistently maintain its 38 per month production rate, Cronin said.

""I don't think anyone's overly agitated,"" he said.

Cronin declined to forecast when the MAX 10, the largest MAX model, will be certified, but said he was confident it would happen. Boeing had planned to secure certification this year, but major customer Ryanair said it expects it in 2025.

Avolon on Friday published its annual outlook, predicting the value of new aircraft deliveries would increase by 15% in 2024 to $100 billion, while airlines' net profit would rise by 10% to $26 billion.
